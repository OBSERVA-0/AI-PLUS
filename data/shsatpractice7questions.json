He writes, \"Technical progress seems to many to be the necessary and infallible way to obtain human wellbeing and happiness, and the latter is identified with pleasure and satisfaction on a material level.\" But human well-being can never result from material satisfaction. Instead, a hyper-focus on technology leads to what Marcel calls a \"broken world\", a \"world divided\" and \"at war with itself\". By 'broken', 'divided' and 'at war with itself', Marcel mean that, existentially, we treat others (and are treated by others) as mere objects, functions, and problems to be solved. But, he also means that our brokenness leads to literal schisms and war. Marcel's generation lived through the rise and ultimate deployment of nuclear weapons, and like his, our generation constantly faces the threat of their use. The possibility of world war, Marcel believed, throws us into a situation in which humanity could actually eradicate itself, \"The fruits of our amazing technological progress are weapons of mass destruction possessed by many states whose relationships with each other are primarily in terms of power, often blatantly manifest in the desire of conquest.\"\n\nFor a philosopher like Gabriel Marcel, truth can survive even in today's threats. But, this modern age differs from Marcel's, because technologically-enhanced weapons (chemical, nuclear, and digital) are proliferated among state and non-state actors. Ours uses atrocities and the threat of atrocities to subject others into submission. And this age uses the fear of acute suffering to commodify whatever is being sold to the mass public. Philosophers today have the benefit of recent history and a knowledge of power structures, however, as tools with which to stand in the gap, between those who would perpetuate atrocity and those who would suffer from it. On a smaller scale, philosophers are able to name the inevitable despair that comes to those who put their faith in material things, since there is no material thing which is capable of helping the powerless contend with the fundamental loss of meaning in the world.\n\nBut philosophers are those who respond to a call, the vocation of naming evil, fostering meaning, and providing hope to the world. Herein lies the prophetic nature of philosophy's gate-keeping. In Creative Fidelity, Marcel writes, \"Hope consists in asserting that there is at the heart of being, beyond all data, beyond all inventories and all calculations, a mysterious principle which is in connivance with me....I assert that a given order shall be reestablished, that reality is on my side in willing it to be so.

        "passage": "Although we now think of England, Scotland, and Wales as connected pieces of Great Britain or the United Kingdom, England was highly antagonistic toward both its nearest neighbors throughout much of the middle ages. King Edward I of England, who ruled for 1272 to 1307, is mostly remembered for his campaigns of aggression to subdue the Scottish and Welsh. Although his actions were considered tyrannical and unjust by the people whose borders he invaded, Edward was undeniably successful at bringing the Welsh under English rule. He achieved that feat by establishing a system of castles throughout Wales that stands as one of the great architectural achievements of his era.\n\nEdward's castle-building strategy is known as the \"Iron Ring\" because he created a circle of four castles one day's march apart from each other around the area he controlled in Wales. As Edward's influence and military success spread, more castles were added to reflect the expansion of territory. As he gained new land, Edward also refurbished older Welsh castles to incorporate into his system, and Welsh nobles who wanted to find favor with the increasingly powerful English king would even build small castles or fortifications for his troops to use.\n\nThe castles of the Iron Ring shared several general characteristics. For one, they all featured thick, high stone walls. In fact, many of the castles had multiple sets of concentric walls to discourage Welsh warriors from attempting to climb their way into the strongholds. The castles also featured a huge number of arrow loops cut into their stone walls. Arrow loops were thin slits in the dense walls that allowed archers inside the castle to shoot outward and downward at potential invaders without exposing themselves to the shots of enemy archers outside the castle. As this design feature illustrates, the strategy of the \"Iron Ring\" wasn't necessarily to bring the fight to the Welsh but rather to communicate that the King of England was in the area to stay, and no resistance, siege, or assault was going to send his nobles back across the border.\n\nWhile Edward's iron ring of castles was a successful military strategy to frustrate Welsh resistance, it ultimately won the Welsh over for economic purposes. The areas around Edward's castles grew into thriving farm towns and merchant communities, in which laws were well-enforced (which was not the case in the wild woods and back roads of medieval Britain) and local artisans and merchants could get a fair price for their work. While the Welsh did not want to sacrifice their heritage or identity, the prosperity that grew around the castles of the Iron Ring showed them that embracing English rule could be mutually beneficial. In this way, the castles helped create a true middle class in Wales.\n\nToday, four of the original castles of the Iron Ring make up a World Heritage Site. Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, and Beaumaris castles still stand as reminders of Edward I's incredible military and economic vision in Wales.

        "passage": "Although we now think of England, Scotland, and Wales as connected pieces of Great Britain or the United Kingdom, England was highly antagonistic toward both its nearest neighbors throughout much of the middle ages. King Edward I of England, who ruled for 1272 to 1307, is mostly remembered for his campaigns of aggression to subdue the Scottish and Welsh. Although his actions were considered tyrannical and unjust by the people whose borders he invaded, Edward was undeniably successful at bringing the Welsh under English rule. He achieved that feat by establishing a system of castles throughout Wales that stands as one of the great architectural achievements of his era.\n\nEdward's castle-building strategy is known as the \"Iron Ring\" because he created a circle of four castles one day's march apart from each other around the area he controlled in Wales. As Edward's influence and military success spread, more castles were added to reflect the expansion of territory. As he gained new land, Edward also refurbished older Welsh castles to incorporate into his system, and Welsh nobles who wanted to find favor with the increasingly powerful English king would even build small castles or fortifications for his troops to use.\n\nThe castles of the Iron Ring shared several general characteristics. For one, they all featured thick, high stone walls. In fact, many of the castles had multiple sets of concentric walls to discourage Welsh warriors from attempting to climb their way into the strongholds. The castles also featured a huge number of arrow loops cut into their stone walls. Arrow loops were thin slits in the dense walls that allowed archers inside the castle to shoot outward and downward at potential invaders without exposing themselves to the shots of enemy archers outside the castle. As this design feature illustrates, the strategy of the \"Iron Ring\" wasn't necessarily to bring the fight to the Welsh but rather to communicate that the King of England was in the area to stay, and no resistance, siege, or assault was going to send his nobles back across the border.\n\nWhile Edward's iron ring of castles was a successful military strategy to frustrate Welsh resistance, it ultimately won the Welsh over for economic purposes. The areas around Edward's castles grew into thriving farm towns and merchant communities, in which laws were well-enforced (which was not the case in the wild woods and back roads of medieval Britain) and local artisans and merchants could get a fair price for their work. While the Welsh did not want to sacrifice their heritage or identity, the prosperity that grew around the castles of the Iron Ring showed them that embracing English rule could be mutually beneficial. In this way, the castles helped create a true middle class in Wales.\n\nToday, four of the original castles of the Iron Ring make up a World Heritage Site. Caernarfon, Conwy, Harlech, and Beaumaris castles still stand as reminders of Edward I's incredible military and economic vision in Wales. Although the original living quarters of the castles have not stood the test of time, the breathtaking walls designed to keep the English in Wales and the Welsh out of English castles still stand as a testament to the long and complex history between the two neighbors.\n\n| \"Iron Ring Castles\" Included in the modern World Heritage Site | Caernarfon | Conwy | Beaumaris | Harlech |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Year Construction Concluded | 1330 (Abandoned) | 1289 (Completed) | 1330 (Abandoned) | 1289 (Completed) |",

And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on, the other was on the table near her hand, her veil was but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.\n\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me.

And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on, the other was on the table near her hand, her veil was but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.\n\nIt was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.\n\n\"Who is it?\" said the lady at the table.\n\"Pip, ma'am.\"\n\"Pip?\"\n\"Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come-to play.\"\n\"Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.\"\n\nIt was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.\n\n\"Look at me,\" said Miss Havisham. \"You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?\"\nI regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer \"No.\"\n\"Do you know what I touch here?\" she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on her left side.\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\"What do I touch?\"\n\"Your heart.\"\n\"Broken!\"\n\nShe uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.

Tech advocates stress that computers and internet technology allow students to learn at their own pace in an environment that makes them feel comfortable, whereas the traditional classroom set a pace that many learners couldn't keep up with and often made students feel uncomfortable.
