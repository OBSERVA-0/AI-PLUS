It's thanks in part to languages that we have become the dominant species on our planet.\n\nBut what exactly is language, and how does it work? How was language created, and how did it change over time? Why is it still a challenge to communicate with those who speak different languages? Why is it, exactly, that the word \"dog\" refers to a furry, four-legged creature that barks and bites? These questions and more are the focus of linguists, or those who study language.\n\nYou might ask yourself: \"How can there be a whole field of study devoted to language?

        "passage": "Most people take for granted the fact that we can communicate clearly with one another. Yet it's nothing short of amazing that we're able to make ourselves understood to one another at all - to convey complicated thoughts and ideas to other people. It's thanks in part to languages that we have become the dominant species on our planet.\n\nBut what exactly is language, and how does it work? How was language created, and how did it change over time? Why is it still a challenge to communicate with those who speak different languages? Why is it, exactly, that the word \"dog\" refers to a furry, four-legged creature that barks and bites? These questions and more are the focus of linguists, or those who study language.\n\nYou might ask yourself: \"How can there be a whole field of study devoted to language? There's nothing more to it than reading, writing, speaking, and listening, right?\" In reality, languages are as complex and nuanced as the way we use them. Thus, the field of linguistics is focused on learning about languages. Though the field of linguistics is actually quite broad, it can be thought of in two parts: the first has to do with the structure of a language, while the second has to do with how language is used.\n\nThere are many parts to a language. The most basic component of languages are words. Morphology refers to the study of words themselves - how they are used in sentences, how they've developed over time, how some words are related to others, and so on. If words are the building blocks of a language, then sentences are the buildings and skyscrapers. Syntax refers to the study of those buildings - what rules to follow when constructing a sentence, which types of words come before others, and so forth. Then, of course, are the way words are spoken - the way they sound, and what they mean. Phonology, semantics, and pragmatics refer to the study of sounds in languages - how the words themselves sound when spoken, and what they mean depending on order and context.\n\nUnlike the study of the structure of a language, the study of language usage focuses more on how people utilize languages. In historical linguistics, for example, linguists are focused on how and why languages change over time. Psycholinguistics, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with studying the psychological and neurological factors that allow people to develop linguistic skills. Psycholinguists study everything from how people learn a language to how they are able to draw on a language to convey their ideas.",

        "passage": "The Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California, is a sprawling green haven that attracts locals and visitors alike. Each year, more than 10 million people pay a visit to the park's 1,000 acres of public land, museums, gardens, statues, and more.\n\nOne of the oldest and most visited fixtures in the park is the Japanese Tea Garden. The Tea Garden was not originally planned to be a permanent part of the Golden Gate Park, however. Initially, the Tea Garden was built for the 1894 World's Fair to showcase San Francisco's year-round mild weather. After the World's Fair ended, a Japanese resident of San Francisco by the name of Makoto Hagiwara suggested that the temporary garden be made permanent. The superintendent of the entire park, John McLaren, agreed to Hagiwara's request. McLaren reasoned that such an exotic and unique addition to the rest of the Golden Gate Park would attract visitors and help further develop and beautify the park.\n\nMcLaren put Hagiwara in charge of developing the Japanese Tea Garden, naming him the official caretaker of the garden. Hagiwara served in that capacity for 30 years - from 1895 to 1925. During this time, Hagiwara made major developments to the 5 acre garden, turning it from a temporary fair exhibit to a world-class attraction. Hagiwara incorporated both native and imported flora and fauna in the landscape. He imported cherry trees and koi fish from Japan, but mixed these with native plants and birds. The garden took on an authentic Japanese appearance thanks to Hagiwara's guiding hand. For Hagiwara, the garden was not only his life's work, but also his family's home.\n\nMakoto Hagiwara died in 1925, and his daughter and grandchildren became the garden's caretakers.

The Hagiwara family was swept up in one of America's darkest moments: the segregation and imprisonment of Japanese Americans. The Hagiwaras-along with more than 100,000 other Japanese Americans - were forcibly removed from their homes and relocated to various concentration camps throughout the United States.\n\nDue to anti-Japanese feelings, the Japanese Tea Garden was renamed the 'Oriental Tea Garden.' Anything in the garden that even sniffed of Japan - including the Hagiwaras' multi-generational home and ancestral shrine - was destroyed or removed. While the Hagiwaras were imprisoned, the garden fell victim to neglect, and many plants and garden arrangements were lost.\n\nAfter the war, the Hagiwaras remained relatively uninvolved with the garden's recovery, and were never reimbursed for their losses.

Bingham received degrees from the University of California, Yale, and Harvard. He was as prolific a teacher as he was a learner, and held teaching positions at Harvard, Princeton, and Yale.\n\nOver the years, Bingham held many positions. His interest in South and Latin America is evidenced by these positions. From 1907-1910, he was a lecturer of South American History and Geography. From 1908-1930, he was a curator of South American History. From 1915-1924, he was professor of Latin American History. Yet Bingham was most famous not for rousing lectures, but for his 1911 expedition to South America. His expedition would result in one of the greatest archaeological rediscoveries of the century: the ruins of Machu Picchu.\n\nBingham's first trip to the Peruvian town of Cuzco, in 1909, left him yearning to see more of what the Incas had built. During that trip, he visited the ruins of Choqquequirau. These ruins were widely believed to be the last capital of the Inca civilization. However, based on his studies, Bingham believed differently. He believed that the last capital of the Incas still remained to be found. Though not a trained archaeologist, Bingham was determined to prove his theory. He organized another expedition to do so. After securing financial support from Yale and the National Geographic Society, he embarked on his 1911 expedition.\n\nFrom Cuzco, Bingham and the rest of the expedition began their exploration. They traveled first to Urubamba, then to Ollantaytambo. On the sixth day after leaving Cuzco, they arrived at a small, isolated plantation called Mandorpampa. According to Bingham's 1913 account of the expedition, the owner of Mandorpampa, Melchor Arteaga, made a living selling \"grass and pasturage to passing travelers.\"\n\nUpon meeting Melchor, Bingham inquired as to the location of any nearby ruins. Through his interpreter, Bingham learned that there were indeed ruins very close by. He learned that Melchor would be happy to lead the way there. The rest is, as they say, history.\n\nMelchor did indeed lead Bingham to the ruins of Machu Picchu. Bingham would go on to orchestrate several more expeditions to excavate, catalogue, and preserve the now-famous ruins. Though Bingham didn't find a long-lost biblical relic or recover any sacred stones from a murderous cult, as Jones did in his famous adventures, Bingham and Jones have more in common than most people realize.",

During that trip, he visited the ruins of Choqquequirau. These ruins were widely believed to be the last capital of the Inca civilization. However, based on his studies, Bingham believed differently. He believed that the last capital of the Incas still remained to be found. Though not a trained archaeologist, Bingham was determined to prove his theory. He organized another expedition to do so.

They traveled first to Urubamba, then to Ollantaytambo. On the sixth day after leaving Cuzco, they arrived at a small, isolated plantation called Mandorpampa.

Overweight or obese adults are at a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and even some cancers. Overweight or obese children are particularly vulnerable to type 2 diabetes. More than half of all children diagnosed with type 2 diabetes are obese.\n\nNot only are these health problems dangerous and potentially fatal, but they are also extremely expensive to manage. According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2008 alone, obesity cost Americans nearly $150 billion in medical expenses. On top of this explicit cost are hidden costs associated with a loss of work productivity, estimated to be between $3-6 billion annually.\n\nWith such high health, social, and economic costs, what can be done to reduce the rate of obesity in the country?\n\nOne step taken to address obesity has been to require that some restaurants and food retailers label their menus with the number of calories their foods and drinks contain. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed this rule in December of 2014. The agency hoped that more information would help people make healthier choices. With this rule, the FDA wanted to address one of the greatest factors contributing to obesity in America: the ease with which Americans can obtain inexpensive, high-calorie food and drink.\n\nA person's weight is the result of many different factors that work together. These factors range from those that cannot be controlled - like a person's natural metabolism - to those that can. One controllable factor has to do with a person's dietary choices. In the United States, food portions often contain more energy (i.e. calories) than they need to. Combined with the fact that Americans spend less and less time staying active, high-calorie foods and drinks that are inexpensive, easily accessible, and available in large quantities have contributed to America's soaring obesity rates.\n\nRecently, New York City has taken steps similar to those taken in 2014 by the FDA. Starting December 2015, the New York City Board of Health required restaurants with 15 or more locations nationwide to post high-sodium-level warning labels on their menus. The City cited research that shows how high sodium intake can be dangerous to a person's health.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services state that high sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. To minimize these risks, these government agencies recommended that no person's daily sodium intake exceed 2,300 milligrams.\n\nHopefully, the more people know about how their dietary choices affect their health, the better able they will be to make healthier lifestyle choices.",

        "passage": "It hasn't always been easy to be a scientist. Though today's scientists are often held in high esteem, this wasn't always the case. In the not-too-distant past, many scientists were persecuted for their beliefs. These scientists were ridiculed or worse for making conclusions that were unpopular with the rest of society.\n\nTake, for example, the work of Gregor Mendel. Today, Mendel is hailed as the father of genetics. He studied the characteristics of pea plants - their height, shape, color, and other physical traits. In doing so, Mendel realized that if plants with certain features were bred together, the next generation of pea plant would display certain qualities. Over time, he realized that there was something at work that controlled these characteristics of pea plants. Though he did not know precisely what those forces were, he knew that some forces were recessive and others dominant. Today, we know those forces as genes. We use the term \"genes\" without giving it much thought. But it was not until many years after his discovery - and, unfortunately, after his death - that the significance of Mendel's work was fully appreciated. In fact, his findings were initially rejected by his peers.\n\nMere rejection, however unfortunate, pales in comparison to persecution at the hands of the Inquisition. In 1615, Galileo Galilei's theories on heliocentrism were submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccolo Lorini. Galileo believed that the bodies in the solar system revolved around the sun, not the earth. In Lorini's point of view, Galileo was reinterpreting the Bible, an activity that was prohibited by the Roman Catholic Church's Council of Trent. This was, unfortunately for Galileo, not his first run-in with the Church. Just years prior, he had needed to answer to the Grand Duchess of Florence for unrelated scientific claims. Galileo was ordered by the Inquisition to cease his work on heliocentrism.\n\nGalileo obeyed - at least superficially. He began writing a book, which he submitted formally to the Inquisition and Pope for approval. Permission for Galileo to publish the book was granted, and the book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems was published in 1632. Despite the permission obtained from the Church, Galileo was summoned before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani and charged with heresy for publishing the book. The Church formally condemned him for his beliefs in 1633. In addition, the Church banned his book and included it in the infamous Index of Forbidden Books.\n\nUltimately, Galileo avoided a far more horrible fate than many of his contemporaries. He was sentenced to house arrest for the rest of his life. Still, Galileo was able to work. While under arrest, Galileo completed Two New Sciences - his seminal work.\n\nGalileo did not live to see his work truly appreciated; he died in 1642 in his villa.
