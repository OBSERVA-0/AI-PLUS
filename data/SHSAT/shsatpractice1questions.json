When people see cockroaches in their homes, they stomp them, spray them with poison, set traps for them – anything to get rid of the hated brown insects. But the battle is often a losing one, and for good reason. Cockroaches have a superb ability to survive, an ability that has made them thrive on Earth for millions and millions of years.\n\nParagraph 2\nLiving fossils, cockroaches were crawling around on Earth 320 million years ago, about 150 million years before dinosaurs appeared. They even have an era named after them, the Age of Cockroaches, otherwise known as the Carboniferous period. Because of their adaptability, including their willingness to eat almost anything available, they have seen many species come and go.\n\nParagraph 3\nThe easygoing food habits of cockroaches are due to the variety of organisms dwelling in their digestive tract. These bacteria and protozoans enable the insects to eat a wide range of matter, including flower buds, leaf litter, feces, paper, glue, paint, soap, and wood. They will eat their own shed skin, cockroach eggs, and even other cockroaches.\n\nParagraph 4\nUnusual survival skills have promoted the success of this order of insects. Cockroaches have adapted to most of Earth's environments. They live in the desert, in the forest, in underground burrows, in electrical equipment, and in almost any kind of human habitation – including space capsules. They can live without food and water for a month and can survive on only water for two months. If they have dry food, they can go without water for five months. And they have good defenses against enemies. Their eyes are extremely sensitive and their bodies are equipped with extra warning devices – sense organs that detect the tiniest motion in the air. A fetid odor keeps some potential predators away and hard, compressible bodies make them amazingly tough.\n\nParagraph 5\nAlthough most human beings shudder at them, cockroaches play an important role in both natural and artificial settings. Most species prefer to live outdoors where they aid in decomposition of vegetable matter and animal feces. Furthermore, in spite of their built-in protection devices, they are significant in the food chain, being eaten by many animals, including (in some circumstances) human beings. In the laboratory they are docile and easy to handle, and they are cooperative research subjects in areas such as disease and nutrition studies.",

    "passage": " Passage 2:\n\nParagraph 1\nIn the centuries just before Rome converted to Christianity, two philosophies were very influential there. One was Epicureanism, founded in Greece early in the fourth century B.C.E. by the philosopher Epicurus. The other was Stoicism, which originated in Cyprus around the same time. Both taught that the highest good in life is a state of inner tranquility that one can achieve by conquering anxieties and passions.\n\nParagraph 2\nBoth schools of thought were materialistic. That is, they taught that everything that exists is composed of matter. They did not recognize a spiritual world. The Epicurean universe contained empty space and matter composed of atoms and compounds. Not only the human body, but also the human soul was thought to be material. Epicurus taught that death brings an end to both. The Stoics also considered both body and soul to be composed of matter. However, they believed that there is a dynamic force they called the Logos. It also consists of matter, according to them, but it is the source of the human soul's ability to reason.\n\nParagraph 3\nEpicureanism taught that pleasure is the ultimate goal of life. Some versions of this philosophy emphasized bodily pleasure and self-indulgence. But Epicurus argued that intellectual pleasure is a greater good than physical pleasure. According to Epicurus, true pleasure depends on inner serenity. People can achieve the serene state by controlling impulses and desires, behaving in moderation, and freeing themselves from attachments and fears. It is especially important, he maintained, to conquer fear of death and of the gods. Epicurus explained that since death is merely the end of existence, it should not be frightening. He also taught that the gods are too far removed from human life to affect it in any way.\n\nParagraph 4\nStoicism taught that one should strive for a \"tranquil soul\" free of all anxiety and fear. The major key to the tranquil soul, according to the Stoics, is to be moderate in all things. Wisdom, courage, and justice, however, were also considered crucial. The Stoics saw a divine order in the universe. They taught that people can live in harmony with the divine order by letting reason – that is, Logos – guide their lives.\n\nParagraph 5\nSince Logos, the dynamic source of reason, was thought to be a part of all human beings, all human souls are related. Each people should feel equal to all other people and connected to all others. A sense of equality and relatedness should lead a person to act according to the rule of brotherly love.",

    "passage": "Paragraph 1\nIn the centuries just before Rome converted to Christianity, two philosophies were very influential there. One was Epicureanism, founded in Greece early in the fourth century B.C.E. by the philosopher Epicurus. The other was Stoicism, which originated in Cyprus around the same time. Both taught that the highest good in life is a state of inner tranquility that one can achieve by conquering anxieties and passions.\n\nParagraph 2\nBoth schools of thought were materialistic. That is, they taught that everything that exists is composed of matter. They did not recognize a spiritual world. The Epicurean universe contained empty space and matter composed of atoms and compounds. Not only the human body, but also the human soul was thought to be material. Epicurus taught that death brings an end to both. The Stoics also considered both body and soul to be composed of matter. However, they believed that there is a dynamic force they called the Logos. It also consists of matter, according to them, but it is the source of the human soul's ability to reason.\n\nParagraph 3\nEpicureanism taught that pleasure is the ultimate goal of life. Some versions of this philosophy emphasized bodily pleasure and self-indulgence. But Epicurus argued that intellectual pleasure is a greater good than physical pleasure. According to Epicurus, true pleasure depends on inner serenity. People can achieve the serene state by controlling impulses and desires, behaving in moderation, and freeing themselves from attachments and fears. It is especially important, he maintained, to conquer fear of death and of the gods. Epicurus explained that since death is merely the end of existence, it should not be frightening. He also taught that the gods are too far removed from human life to affect it in any way.\n\nParagraph 4\nStoicism taught that one should strive for a \"tranquil soul\" free of all anxiety and fear. The major key to the tranquil soul, according to the Stoics, is to be moderate in all things. Wisdom, courage, and justice, however, were also considered crucial. The Stoics saw a divine order in the universe. They taught that people can live in harmony with the divine order by letting reason – that is, Logos – guide their lives.\n\nParagraph 5\nSince Logos, the dynamic source of reason, was thought to be a part of all human beings, all human souls are related.

    "passage": "Paragraph 1\nFor several decades the novels of Louisa May Alcott were a favorite among young readers, especially girls. Her most famous book, Little Women, is still popular in print as well as in its three or four film versions. Most of her works tell of the trials and joys of young people in nineteenth-century New England. Little Women, for example, a novel based on her own early life and the early lives of her three sisters, tells of the struggles of a close-knit family during and after the Civil War. To some modern readers Alcott's stories seem sentimental and moralistic, for she sometimes exaggerates emotion, and she sprinkles her narratives with little sermons. But her emotional scenes can still make readers cry, and her heartwarming vignettes of domestic happiness can still bring smiles to their faces.\n\nParagraph 2\nThe author was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, but grew up in Boston. Her father, Bronson Alcott, was a well-known philosopher and educator with radical ideas. Dissatisfied with contemporary educational practices, he developed an innovative teaching method and put it into practice in his own school, which he opened in 1834. His method used conversation instead of drill and memorization in the teaching of young children. In spite of much negative criticism of his system, he managed to keep the school open for five years.\n\nParagraph 3\nAlthough Bronson Alcott went on to become well known as a philosopher, lecturer, and leader in the movement for the abolition of slavery, he was a poor provider for his family. The family seldom had more than the basic necessities, and the female members of the family had to work hard to provide those. In fact it is said that during one particularly hard winter they would have starved if friends had not given them food.\n\nParagraph 4\nTheir poverty motivated Louisa to venture into a field that would startle some of her fans. Pulp magazines were good markets for thrillers – stories with plenty of action and suspense and, often, violence. Although the magazines were cheap and of inferior quality, they paid well, and Louisa needed the money to help her family. She became a frequent contributor to this market, but always under assumed names. In Little Women, Jo, the main character, helps her family financially by selling stories to the pulp magazines.

    "passage": "Paragraph 1\nFrench Impressionism was one of the most controversial artistic movements of modern times. The Impressionists were nineteenth-century painters who rebelled against the strict rules of classical art laid down by the French Academy. According to eighteenth-century standards, acceptable paintings had to be executed in smooth, precise lines. Except for formal portraits, art had to depict subjects above the level of common life – for example, mythology and history. The Impressionists cast off these restrictions, using experimental techniques to produce spontaneous-looking representations of outdoor scenes and everyday life.\n\nParagraph 2\nThe aim of these rebels was to reproduce what the eye actually sees rather than to give an exact rendering of form. For this reason they studied light and its effects on colors and shapes and strove to represent these effects on canvas. Some Impressionists would paint several pictures of a scene at different times of the day to catch the varying influences of the light. One of their discoveries was that shadows are not always tones of black or brown but tend to contain reflections of the colors in nearby objects. Another discovery was that light can soften the outlines of objects, making shapes appear less precise to the eye than they actually are, and causing the eye to overlook some detail.\n\nParagraph 3\nThe resulting paintings embody techniques drastically different from those used in classical art. Brushstrokes do not carefully outline a shape; rather they suggest it, often with short, side-by-side touches of different colors. These tints look separate only upon close examination, blending when viewed from farther away. Colors are especially radiant because the artists would lay two contrasting primary colors next to each other on the canvas instead of blending chem beforehand on a pallette.\n\nParagraph 4\nThe Impressionists organized their first joint exhibition in 1874. Although some of the public were enthusiastic about this new kind of painting, the establishment was scornful of such radical work. In fact, the term \"Impressionist\" comes from an excoriating review of Claude Monet's painting Impression: Sunrise, in which the critic condemned the work as being not a work of art, but rather an art-less impression, and dubbed the painters not arists, but \"impressionists.\" Rather than denouncing this label for their work, the new school adopted it. In 1877, for the third exhibition of their paintings, the artists themselves described their work as Impressionist. Appreciated at first by other artists and by a small segment of the public, Impressionism gradually gained ground, finally earning acceptance among both the general public and the critics.",

It would increase the cost of machinery and tools to every American businessman and farmer. It would seriously handicap our efforts to prevent an inflationary spiral from eating up the pensions of our older citizens, and our new gains in purchasing power. It would add, Secretary McNamara informed me this morning, an estimated one billion dollars to the cost of our defenses, at a time when every dollar is needed for national security and other purposes. It would make it more difficult for American goods to compete in foreign markets, more difficult to withstand competition from foreign imports, and thus more difficult to improve our balance of payments position, and stem the flow of gold. And it is necessary to stem it for our national security, if we are going to pay for our security commitments abroad. And it would surely handicap our efforts to induce other industries and unions to adopt responsible price and wage policies.\n\nParagraph 3\nThe facts of the matter are that there is no justification for an increase in the steel prices. The recent settlement between the industry and the union, which does not even take place until July 1st, waswidely acknowledged to be non-inflationary, and the whole purpose and effect of this Administration's role, which both parties understood, was to achieve an agreement which would make unnecessary any increase in prices.\n\nParagraph 4\nPrice and wage decisions in this country, except for very limited restrictions in the case of monopolies and national emergency strikes, are and ought to be freely and privately made, bur the American people have a right to expect in return for that freedom, a higher sense of business responsibility for the welfare of their country than has been shown in the last two days.\n\nParagraph 5\nSome time ago I asked each American to consider what he would do for his country and I asked the steel companies.
