    "passage": "Much is spoken about the infamous Genghis Khan, a ruthless Mongol leader who created the largest empire of his time, spanning, at its peak, an area that encompassed parts of the Middle East, Western Europe, and the eastern corners of Asia. Through Genghis' military might, he was able to get many early civilizations to succumb to the strength of the Mongol Empire. However, much less is written about the weapons and war tactics which the ruler utilized to secure such swaths of land. One of the key tools in the Mongol army's arsenal was its array of bows and arrows. Whereas attacks from Mediterranean bows required a three-finger release, a Mongolian bow could be shot using only one's thumb. This led to fewer failed shots and allowed the Mongol armies to unleash a barrage of metal at their foes effectively. Mongols were influenced by contemporaneous Eastern societies in their use of flaming arrows throughout their war campaign. Troops would line the arrows with highly flammable material, such as resin, that they would ignite before shooting. In addition to these unusual but deadly tools of war, Khan's army took advantage of a crucial military strategy. They knew, as many of us know in the modern era, that swift access to information would ensure success. The Mongol army employed swift messengers and message stations which relayed information quickly, like an archaic dial-up online network system. Khan was also particularly successful with a technique dubbed the \"feigned retreat\", in which his troops pretended to evacuate, lowering the opponent's guard, and then came rushing back to ambush their opponents. Khan sent spies to survey the lands that he would take over to plan the best possible battle. The Mongol army was also masterful when it came to intimidating foes, placing troops made of straw on spare horses to create the illusion that his army was larger than its actual size. While Khan was a brilliant leader and tactician, he certainly could not have dominated such a large portion of the globe alone.

    "passage": "Much is spoken about the infamous Genghis Khan, a ruthless Mongol leader who created the largest empire of his time, spanning, at its peak, an area that encompassed parts of the Middle East, Western Europe, and the eastern corners of Asia. Through Genghis' military might, he was able to get many early civilizations to succumb to the strength of the Mongol Empire. However, much less is written about the weapons and war tactics which the ruler utilized to secure such swaths of land. One of the key tools in the Mongol army's arsenal was its array of bows and arrows. Whereas attacks from Mediterranean bows required a three-finger release, a Mongolian bow could be shot using only one's thumb. This led to fewer failed shots and allowed the Mongol armies to unleash a barrage of metal at their foes effectively. Mongols were influenced by contemporaneous Eastern societies in their use of flaming arrows throughout their war campaign. Troops would line the arrows with highly flammable material, such as resin, that they would ignite before shooting. In addition to these unusual but deadly tools of war, Khan's army took advantage of a crucial military strategy. They knew, as many of us know in the modern era, that swift access to information would ensure success. The Mongol army employed swift messengers and message stations which relayed information quickly, like an archaic dial-up online network system. Khan was also particularly successful with a technique dubbed the \"feigned retreat\", in which his troops pretended to evacuate, lowering the opponent's guard, and then came rushing back to ambush their opponents. Khan sent spies to survey the lands that he would take over to plan the best possible battle. The Mongol army was also masterful when it came to intimidating foes, placing troops made of straw on spare horses to create the illusion that his army was larger than its actual size. While Khan was a brilliant leader and tactician, he certainly could not have dominated such a large portion of the globe alone. His loyal army, innovative weaponry, and strategic military conduct earned him the title of the Great Khan of the Mongol Empire.",

    "passage": "The word \"meme' can be traced back to evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book on genetics called The Selfish Gene, published in 1976. When Dawkins used the term, he was referring to an idea that spreads through culture, comparing the concept to the way a gene passes from one person to another. The term evolved over time and has come to colloquially mean \"a funny image on the Internet,\" but despite this change, memes and genes have many shared characteristics. Genes are the basic units of our heritage. Through them, our parents or grandparents may happen to pass on traits to their progeny, from the benign (such as blue eyes or freckles) to the malignant (like a propensity for heart disease or certain types of cancer.) Memes, on the other hand, are passed through spreading thoughts rather than through one's biology, and consequently follow a much shorter-lived cycle that greatly outpaces the rate at which offspring can be conceived. Thus, we have two sets of spreading: one involved with the physical, which is permanent, and the other involved with the mental, which is more ephemeral. A further difference is that one need not necessarily be from the same bloodline to spread a meme. Some genes are more likely to manifest in one's children than others, leading to the distinction between \"dominant\" and recessive\" genes. In much the same way, certain ideas in culture are more prevalent than others. Though humor is highly subjective, there have been attempts to algorithmically predict whether a humorous Internet meme would be successful. A group of researchers, most of whom were from the Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research School of Informatics and Computing in Indiana University, have found that many memes have a half-life, meaning that the amount of times that a joke is replicated halves after its peak, and this phenomenon can be measured on a timeline. Their study also found that there are certain traits within memes that make them more likely to go viral or not, such as depiction of a universal issue. This can be seen in how the faces in Rage Comics were meant to represent the spectrum of human emotion, thus making them relatable across social boundaries and therefore well-known. However, this factor of universality alone is not necessarily enough to ensure success, and a meme's duration also depends on several external factors working in tandem. Dawkins' comparison still holds true today. Whether one observes the beaks of finches or the ideas of various social groups, the concept of passing something down is inexorably linked to our lives.",

    "passage": "Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Sanders is found on buckets of food and the awnings of KFC stores nationwide. However, the Colonel is not just the emblem of a fast food chain - he created the company that has at this point made billions of dollars selling chicken, biscuits, and various forms of soda. While most people recognize the brand of KFC, few people know the story of Sanders' personal life. Even less publicized is the fact that he was once involved in a shootout with a rival businessman. Earlier in his life, Sanders was working at a Shell gas station in a small town in Kentucky. One of his competitors, Matt Stewart, opened a Standard Oil gas station nearby, and he and Sanders would constantly bicker. Sanders painted a sign that directed rail commuters to his Shell gas station. Stewart ended up vandalizing that sign. Sanders, at that point angry, called Stewart and threatened to kill him. Sanders repainted the sign, and Stewart painted over it again, likely figuring Sanders was too cowardly to react. When Sanders and two of his managers learned that Stewart was painting over their sign again, they armed themselves and went to look for him, probably not knowing that Stewart was carrying a gun as well. As they discovered him painting over the sign again, there was a shootout between the two parties, and one of Sanders' higher-ups instantly died after taking three bullets. Then, Sanders and his surviving partner surrounded Stewart, and Sanders shot his opponent in the shoulder, but ultimately spared Stewart's life. The Colonel must have managed to elocute well in court, because after everyone heard Sanders' side of the story, he had his charges dropped. In contrast, his rival, perhaps not as skilled with his words, ended up serving 18 years in jail. The gas station Sanders worked in went on to dominate business in that small Kentucky town, and this example serves as one of the earliest examples in the Colonel's life of aggressive business tactics.

    "passage": "Historically, we've always wanted our plans for cities to be bigger and more impressive, evident even back in the early 20th century when a designer wanted to create a flying railway travelling at 150 mph connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles (even though trains then typically travelled at a quarter of that speed). However, some city planners who get the green light go a bit wild with their ideas. In 1924, traffic congestion in New York City was so bad that it cost the city roughly $1.5 million a day. Traffic commissioner John A. Harriss proposed draining the East River, which would add 50 square miles of land to New York City. His plan included putting City Hall on top of the 5-mile long dam and stuffing a parking garage underneath the dam. To make up for the destruction of so much water space, he decided the plan would include carving a canal through Queens. The commissioner's dam was never built. Another example of a grandiose engineering ambition came when the oil industry in Alaska boomed in the late 1960s. To manufacture warm temperatures in a frigid land, Alaska's oil companies proposed an $800 million project: a giant dome over a city that would be named Seward's Success. This dome, which would be placed north of Anchorage, was expected to control the area's climate, keep a steady room temperature, draw approximately 40,000 residents, and feature monorails and moving sidewalks. Issues with logistics and technology prevented the city from becoming a reality. A few years ago, the Shanghai Industrial Corporation hired British firm Arup to plan a fully sustainable city on the outskirts of Shanghai to offset its large amounts of pollution. The government anticipated that the city, Dongtan, would have half a million residents by 2050. All the food would be locally grown, and the metropolis would strive to have absolutely no pollution. At least 1 billion euros were invested towards the project, but it never came to fruition due to political and financial problems. Though not of all these projects were fully realized, some at least partially manifested. In 1935, American architect Frank Lloyd Wright presented his idea of a city that included plots of land for farming. Wright believed that overcrowding and ultra-capitalism would disappear in a few generations as people returned to a more natural state. Every resident in his city would have an acre of land. While his idea didn't work out, it seemed to predict the creation of suburbs. Another whimsical project that partially came to fruition was Walt Disney's EPCOT, originally intended to be its own community in the middle of the state of Florida, with a 30-story hotel at its center. Disney envisioned his city in 1966 as never being finished, and said it would be 43 square miles - about twice the size of Manhattan. He also imagined separate street levels for pedestrians, automobiles, and trucks to maximize safety. Disney said that his city would boast a 100% employment rate. His idea was tamed significantly, and EPCOT is now a Disney theme park. Whether in the U.S. or abroad, in the past or in the present, our conceptions of the future will always be impressive.",

At least 1 billion euros were invested towards the project, but it never came to fruition due to political and financial problems. Though not of all these projects were fully realized, some at least partially manifested. In 1935, American architect Frank Lloyd Wright presented his idea of a city that included plots of land for farming. Wright believed that overcrowding and ultra-capitalism would disappear in a few generations as people returned to a more natural state. Every resident in his city would have an acre of land. While his idea didn't work out, it seemed to predict the creation of suburbs. Another whimsical project that partially came to fruition was Walt Disney's EPCOT, originally intended to be its own community in the middle of the state of Florida, with a 30-story hotel at its center. Disney envisioned his city in 1966 as never being finished, and said it would be 43 square miles - about twice the size of Manhattan. He also imagined separate street levels for pedestrians, automobiles, and trucks to maximize safety. Disney said that his city would boast a 100% employment rate. His idea was tamed significantly, and EPCOT is now a Disney theme park. Whether in the U.S. or abroad, in the past or in the present, our conceptions of the future will always be impressive.",

However, some city planners who get the green light go a bit wild with their ideas. In 1924, traffic congestion in New York City was so bad that it cost the city roughly $1.5 million a day. Traffic commissioner John A. Harriss proposed draining the East River, which would add 50 square miles of land to New York City. His plan included putting City Hall on top of the 5-mile long dam and stuffing a parking garage underneath the dam. To make up for the destruction of so much water space, he decided the plan would include carving a canal through Queens. The commissioner's dam was never built. Another example of a grandiose engineering ambition came when the oil industry in Alaska boomed in the late 1960s. To manufacture warm temperatures in a frigid land, Alaska's oil companies proposed an $800 million project: a giant dome over a city that would be named Seward's Success. This dome, which would be placed north of Anchorage, was expected to control the area's climate, keep a steady room temperature, draw approximately 40,000 residents, and feature monorails and moving sidewalks.

    "passage": "Some animals are born with whiter fur or skin than usual. These white animals are called \"albino.\" If, on the other hand, a creature is born with darker skin, it is known as \"melanistic.\" It may be surprising for someone to see an animal with a lighter or darker skin tone than usual. For instance, while people normally associate giraffes with light sandy fur, there are melanistic giraffes in the wild that blend with the night. However, this is not necessarily an evolutionary advantage, as most giraffes that currently roam the savannah use the light color of their fur to blend in with the surroundings of the plants that grow around the area. What causes such unusual pigmentation in albino and melanistic animals? Usually, the anomalous skin color stems from a mutation in the animal's genes - every animal has instructions in its genetic code that determines its melanin, or the color of its skin. However, when an animal is born albino, it means that some part of their genetic sequencing had an error, as this phenomenon occurs when an animal's genes produce a lack of melanin. Conversely, melanistic traits in animals arise when there is an abundance of melanin in the animal's genetic code. While it may seem that only mammals have the capacity to become albino, practically every member of the animal kingdom, from crocodiles to fish, have seen cases of glowing white skin. This trait manifests itself in so many creatures because every animal has a gene that determines its skill color. This means that there may have once existed albino dinosaurs, although dinosaurs with this trait would be very rare. While animals with albinism fascinate people, the opposite has been true about albino people in ancient culture. There is an ancient cultural association of pale skin and witchcraft, and evil creatures such as vampires are portrayed as having ghostly white skin. This issue is compounded further among certain regions of Africa, where people born with a lack of melanin are often subject to abduction or are even hunted down.
