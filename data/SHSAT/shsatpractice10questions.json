        "passage": "Excerpt from The Scarlet Letter\n\nBy Nathaniel Hawthorne\n\n(1) One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be told. The very first thing which she had noticed in her life, was–what?–not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was–shall we say it?–the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and putting up her little hand she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavouring to tear it away, so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl's baby-hand. Again, as if her mother's agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile. From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment's safety: not a moment's calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes.\n\n(2) Once this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's eyes while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; and suddenly for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face in the small black mirror of Pearl's eye. It was a face, fiendlike, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.\n\n(3) In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after Pearl grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter. Hester's first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl's wild eyes. Still came the battery offlowers, almost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out–or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it–from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\n\n(4) \"Child, what art thou?\" cried the mother.\n\n(5) \"Oh, I am your little Pearl!\" answered the child.\n\n(6) But while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.\n\n(7) \"Art thou my child, in very truth?\" asked Hester.\n\n(8) Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself.\n\n(9) \"Yes; I am little Pearl!\" repeated the child, continuing her antics.\n\n(10) \"Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!\" said the mother half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering. \"Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither?\"\n\n(11) \"Tell me, mother!\" said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and pressing herself close to her knees. \"Do thou tell me!\"\n\n(12) \"Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!\" answered Hester Prynne.\n\n(13) But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter.\n\n(14) \"He did not send me!\" cried she, positively. \"I have no Heavenly Father!\"\n\n(15) \"Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!\" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. \"He sent us all into the world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?\"\n\n(16) \"Tell me! Tell me!\" repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing and capering about the floor. \"It is thou that must tell me!\"\n\n(17) But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered–betwixt a smile and a shudder–the talk of the neighbouring townspeople, who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring: such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their mother's sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose. Luther, according to the scandal of his monkish enemies, was a brat of that hellish breed; nor was Pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the New England Puritans.",

It was a face, fiendlike, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them.

Hester's first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl's wild eyes.

At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out–or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it–from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\n\n(4) \"Child, what art thou?\" cried the mother.\n\n(5) \"Oh, I am your little Pearl!\" answered the child.\n\n(6) But while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.\n\n(7) \"Art thou my child, in very truth?\" asked Hester.\n\n(8) Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself.\n\n(9) \"Yes; I am little Pearl!\" repeated the child, continuing her antics.\n\n(10) \"Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!\" said the mother half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering. \"Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither?\"\n\n(11) \"Tell me, mother!\" said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and pressing herself close to her knees. \"Do thou tell me!\"\n\n(12) \"Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!\" answered Hester Prynne.\n\n(13) But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter.\n\n(14) \"He did not send me!\" cried she, positively. \"I have no Heavenly Father!\"\n\n(15) \"Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!\" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. \"He sent us all into the world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?\"\n\n(16) \"Tell me! Tell me!\" repeated Pearl, no longer seriously, but laughing and capering about the floor. \"It is thou that must tell me!\"\n\n(17) But Hester could not resolve the query, being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt. She remembered–betwixt a smile and a shudder–the talk of the neighbouring townspeople, who, seeking vainly elsewhere for the child's paternity, and observing some of her odd attributes, had given out that poor little Pearl was a demon offspring: such as, ever since old Catholic times, had occasionally been seen on earth, through the agency of their mother's sin, and to promote some foul and wicked purpose.

        "passage": "Excerpt from The Scarlet Letter\n\nBy Nathaniel Hawthorne\n\n(1) One peculiarity of the child's deportment remains yet to be told. The very first thing which she had noticed in her life, was–what?–not the mother's smile, responding to it, as other babies do, by that faint, embryo smile of the little mouth, remembered so doubtfully afterwards, and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile. By no means! But that first object of which Pearl seemed to become aware was–shall we say it?–the scarlet letter on Hester's bosom! One day, as her mother stooped over the cradle, the infant's eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter; and putting up her little hand she grasped at it, smiling, not doubtfully, but with a decided gleam, that gave her face the look of a much older child. Then, gasping for breath, did Hester Prynne clutch the fatal token, instinctively endeavouring to tear it away, so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of Pearl's baby-hand. Again, as if her mother's agonised gesture were meant only to make sport for her, did little Pearl look into her eyes, and smile. From that epoch, except when the child was asleep, Hester had never felt a moment's safety: not a moment's calm enjoyment of her. Weeks, it is true, would sometimes elapse, during which Pearl's gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter; but then, again, it would come at unawares, like the stroke of sudden death, and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes.\n\n(2) Once this freakish, elvish cast came into the child's eyes while Hester was looking at her own image in them, as mothers are fond of doing; and suddenly for women in solitude, and with troubled hearts, are pestered with unaccountable delusions she fancied that she beheld, not her own miniature portrait, but another face in the small black mirror of Pearl's eye. It was a face, fiendlike, full of smiling malice, yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well, though seldom with a smile, and never with malice in them. It was as if an evil spirit possessed the child, and had just then peeped forth in mockery. Many a time afterwards had Hester been tortured, though less vividly, by the same illusion.\n\n(3) In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after Pearl grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter. Hester's first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands. But whether from pride or resignation, or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain, she resisted the impulse, and sat erect, pale as death, looking sadly into little Pearl's wild eyes. Still came the battery offlowers, almost invariably hitting the mark, and covering the mother's breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world, nor knew how to seek it in another. At last, her shot being all expended, the child stood still and gazed at Hester, with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping out–or, whether it peeped or no, her mother so imagined it–from the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes.\n\n(4) \"Child, what art thou?\" cried the mother.\n\n(5) \"Oh, I am your little Pearl!\" answered the child.\n\n(6) But while she said it, Pearl laughed, and began to dance up and down with the humoursome gesticulation of a little imp, whose next freak might be to fly up the chimney.\n\n(7) \"Art thou my child, in very truth?\" asked Hester.\n\n(8) Nor did she put the question altogether idly, but, for the moment, with a portion of genuine earnestness; for, such was Pearl's wonderful intelligence, that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence, and might not now reveal herself.\n\n(9) \"Yes; I am little Pearl!\" repeated the child, continuing her antics.\n\n(10) \"Thou art not my child! Thou art no Pearl of mine!\" said the mother half playfully; for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering. \"Tell me, then, what thou art, and who sent thee hither?\"\n\n(11) \"Tell me, mother!\" said the child, seriously, coming up to Hester, and pressing herself close to her knees. \"Do thou tell me!\"\n\n(12) \"Thy Heavenly Father sent thee!\" answered Hester Prynne.\n\n(13) But she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child. Whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness, or because an evil spirit prompted her, she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter.\n\n(14) \"He did not send me!\" cried she, positively. \"I have no Heavenly Father!\"\n\n(15) \"Hush, Pearl, hush! Thou must not talk so!\" answered the mother, suppressing a groan. \"He sent us all into the world. He sent even me, thy mother. Then, much more thee! Or, if not, thou strange and elfish child, whence didst thou come?\"\n\n(16) \"Tell me!
