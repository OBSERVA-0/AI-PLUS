    "passage": "After American slaves were \"freed\", many white landowners scrambled for loopholes in the wording of the constitutional amendment so they could find an excuse to keep slavery going. Many of these white landowners made black men work for them in coal mines, forcing these men to labor under conditions that some historians consider even worse than slavery. While this form of bondage occurred in the late 1800s, even in modern times, there is the idea of \"wage slavery\". The southern United States has several states with minimum wages much lower than the national average, and some states, such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, boast no minimum wage at all. Marginalized groups, desperate for work, will toil in certain jobs despite the pitiful pay because they sometimes have few other options. The issue of pay and servitude in modern times is found outside of the United States as well. For example, the lower-class in Pakistan creates houses for wealthy landowners as a means of paying off a loan the upper-class has given them. Unfortunately, most laborers who work for these landowners are lied to their masters tell them they only need to work until the loan is paid off. However, the master intends to keep the family in servitude forever, and will never say when or whether the loan has been paid. In Dubai, slavery manages to continue as workers from Bangladesh work on the United Arab Emirates' many construction projects. These workers are told in their home country that their lives will become a paradise once they move to the Emirates, but instead, the Bangladeshis get their passports taken away once they enter the country and face deplorable working and living conditions. In a world where human rights are paramount, and even in Dubai, a city where there is so much wealth that there are gold bar dispensing machines, how is it that wages are kept so low? The simple answer is greed. In the words of one resident, \"Most companies are owned by the government, so they oppose human rights laws because it will reduce their profit margins.

    "passage": "Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are some of the toughest creatures that scientists have ever discovered. Despite sharing a name with a large mammal, water bears are microscopic creatures without backbones. Water bears get their unique name because they have tiny paws and distinctive walking style, which make the creatures resemble bears with many extra legs. Tardigrades can survive temperature extremes, whether they are tolerating extreme heat or cold. In fact, tardigrades can even survive the conditions of space. Why does this tiny creature seem practically indestructible? The main reason that water bears have such incredible endurance relates to cryptobiosis, a process that the water bear uses to slow down its metabolism, similar to how actual bears hibernate to slow their body's processes. When the water bear undergoes cryptobiosis, it can dry itself out to an extent where it retains just 3 percent of its water content. This ability, known as desiccation, lets the water bear survive extreme conditions, and it can be revived when it comes in contact with water. The most impressive aspect about desiccation is that water bears can remain dried out for many years. Bears can tolerate the cold, but not nearly to the extreme that tardigrades can. Polar bears, covered in fur and even warm while hibernating, brave arctic temperatures and have an average internal body temperature on par with that of a human. In fact, because polar bears have evolved to be so efficient at dealing with glacial temperatures, it is difficult for them to remain in a warm area for too long. While polar bears have impressive internal temperature regulation, studies of tardigrades have found that these creatures tolerate temperatures close to absolute zero, the coldest temperature possible. If scientists continue to study the tardigrade, they can potentially unlock its secrets and learn not only how it protects itself but also potentially learn how to apply those abilities to the human world and help people survive temperature extremes.

    "passage": "Tardigrades, also known as water bears, are some of the toughest creatures that scientists have ever discovered. Despite sharing a name with a large mammal, water bears are microscopic creatures without backbones. Water bears get their unique name because they have tiny paws and distinctive walking style, which make the creatures resemble bears with many extra legs. Tardigrades can survive temperature extremes, whether they are tolerating extreme heat or cold. In fact, tardigrades can even survive the conditions of space. Why does this tiny creature seem practically indestructible? The main reason that water bears have such incredible endurance relates to cryptobiosis, a process that the water bear uses to slow down its metabolism, similar to how actual bears hibernate to slow their body's processes. When the water bear undergoes cryptobiosis, it can dry itself out to an extent where it retains just 3 percent of its water content.

    "passage": "In 2010, a group of miners working in a copper and gold mine several miles from a mid-sized city in Chile found themselves stuck underground. Four years prior, in another mine near the same city, two trucks had collided with each other, causing an accident that killed two workers and trapped another 70 in the mine. Fortunately, nearby miners dug a tunnel to their compatriots and everyone else escaped mostly unscathed. The situation in 2010, however, was much more complicated. In 2010, 33 men were trapped in a cave collapse, 3 miles from their mine's entrance and about two-fifths of a mile deep. Given that situation, many Chileans feared that this cave-in was a death sentence for those workers. The mining company involved also had a long history of safety infractions, so it would not have surprised the citizens that the workers' lives were in danger. Seventeen days after the incident, the mining company dug small holes into the area where they thought the workers would be. The miners tied a message to the probe that the company sent down, informing the world that the subterranean laborers were still alive. During that time, the group tried to escape via ventilation shafts, but the ladders that would normally have been present and were required by mining regulation codes were missing. The families of the miners, understandably, took legal action against the mining company for failing to comply with all the necessary legal regulations (however, the lawsuit ended a few years later with the company escaping any penalty). The issues with attempting any rescue were manifold. For one, an improperly placed hole could cause even further damage beyond the initial collapse. Secondly, the entrance to the area where the miners were stuck was mainly accessible by a spiral staircase rather than a straight drop. The issue was compounded by the age of the mines, which were over a century old. Eventually, engineers figured that their best plan was to dig a shaft, 2 feet in diameter, excavate over 2000 feet down, and hoist the men up one by one from there. The engineers decided not to let the men know how long the rescue attempt would take (which they figured would span the duration of months), but did decide to send down a video camera to see how the miners were doing. The camera discovered the men had lost weight, as they had to stretch three days' worth of rations and spent all their time in a scorching underground tunnel. The men would constantly try to boost each other's morale, but one such figure, known to the other miners as the group's comedian, would often excuse himself to another room to weep. Eventually, after 70 days in the mine, the men were lifted out in a rescue capsule, one at a time. The foreman of the group jested that they had come from a long shift. While the men were revered as heroes, given grand tours of the world, and invited on television networks days after their rescue, many have been psychologically damaged by the incident. Some of them find comfort in hobbies such as soccer, or in their children. Others find solace in work. However they choose to cope with the trauma, their story is one that makes the strongest case for large companies to comply with basic safety measures and have routine safety checks to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future.",

    "passage": "In 2010, a group of miners working in a copper and gold mine several miles from a mid-sized city in Chile found themselves stuck underground. Four years prior, in another mine near the same city, two trucks had collided with each other, causing an accident that killed two workers and trapped another 70 in the mine. Fortunately, nearby miners dug a tunnel to their compatriots and everyone else escaped mostly unscathed. The situation in 2010, however, was much more complicated. In 2010, 33 men were trapped in a cave collapse, 3 miles from their mine's entrance and about two-fifths of a mile deep. Given that situation, many Chileans feared that this cave-in was a death sentence for those workers. The mining company involved also had a long history of safety infractions, so it would not have surprised the citizens that the workers' lives were in danger. Seventeen days after the incident, the mining company dug small holes into the area where they thought the workers would be. The miners tied a message to the probe that the company sent down, informing the world that the subterranean laborers were still alive. During that time, the group tried to escape via ventilation shafts, but the ladders that would normally have been present and were required by mining regulation codes were missing. The families of the miners, understandably, took legal action against the mining company for failing to comply with all the necessary legal regulations (however, the lawsuit ended a few years later with the company escaping any penalty). The issues with attempting any rescue were manifold. For one, an improperly placed hole could cause even further damage beyond the initial collapse. Secondly, the entrance to the area where the miners were stuck was mainly accessible by a spiral staircase rather than a straight drop. The issue was compounded by the age of the mines, which were over a century old. Eventually, engineers figured that their best plan was to dig a shaft, 2 feet in diameter, excavate over 2000 feet down, and hoist the men up one by one from there. The engineers decided not to let the men know how long the rescue attempt would take (which they figured would span the duration of months), but did decide to send down a video camera to see how the miners were doing.

    "passage": "The nation of Liberia in West Africa has had a complex history. To understand its existence as an autonomous region, it is necessary to look at several elements of the United States that were present during the early 1800s. During this time, slavery was rampant and many slaves looked to the continent of Africa as an ideal world to which they could escape and return to their homelands. When the \"Back to Africa\" movement gained momentum, thousands of free black men or freed slaves settled in Liberia and took vestiges of American culture with them. The capital of Liberia, Monrovia, was named after the president of the United States at the time - James Monroe. The flag's star, as well as its red and white stripes, are arranged in a way that makes them resemble the American flag. The Liberian constitution is based on American ideals, the country's first president was born in America, and the official language is English. The name \"Liberia\" literally translates to \"Land of the Free\" in Latin. Many of Liberia's issues were worsened by the rule of President William R. Tolbert in the 1970s. The president gave friends and family members cabinet positions and cut ties with several allied countries, believing that Liberia's economic independence was more important. The Tolbert administration suggested raising the price of rice bags, a move that made residents suspicious knowing that Tolbert and his political friends had rice farms and would stand to benefit. A political party sprung up in opposition to Tolbert's policies - the second major political party in a system that had been dominated by the True Whig Party since the country's inception as an independent state. A month after Tolbert ordered the opposing party to be dismantled and arrested several of its key members, he was killed by a group of rebels from the Liberian Armed Forces. Tolbert had American ancestry and the rebels were all indigenous Liberians, which was possibly another point of contention. The next leader and head of the coup, Samuel Doe, likely to have taken power after massive voter fraud, ruled for the next decade. He was Liberia's first native-born president. The United States grew leery of Doe's corrupt government and disinvested in the nation. A politician with a grudge against Doe gathered a militia in a neighboring country and killed Doe. Having lost two presidents in one decade, the nation was in turmoil. Two civil wars broke out, and many of the fighters were child soldiers, brainwashed from a young age to fight for their elders' side. The conflict was settled with a peace agreement in 2003. Like its role model from the west, Liberia, too, came to learn the dangers of political disagreement and the costs of civil war. Today, the region is run by its first woman president, a Harvard economist who negotiated deals that have slashed large chunks of the republic's debt.

    "passage": "In September 2015, NASA's probes on Mars found strong evidence that the red planet may currently have liquid water, and such a discovery was a source of intense excitement. If liquid water, an ingredient necessary to life on Earth, could be found elsewhere, perhaps life may exist on another planet as well? A discovery that would prove even the existence of unicellular organisms on areas other than Earth would signify a scientific breakthrough and shatter the collective perception of the universe. If the universe is indeed infinite, allowing for an endless permutation of possibilities, then life seems guaranteed to exist. However, scientists on Earth have yet to discover extraterrestrial life. This conundrum is named the Fermi Paradox, named after a physicist who lamented the correlation between the number of planets and our lack of evidence for life in them. Fermi detailed several possibilities for why this might be. For one, perhaps this life exists, but only in the form of microscopic organisms. Another option is that we are in such a remote part of the galaxy that it would be nearly impossible to find anyone else - like looking for a drop of water in a particularly dry region. Perhaps Earth represents the first time life has ever formed in the universe, or even the last. The Fermi Paradox posits yet other explanations. While humans can harness the resources of their host planet (which makes humanity a Type I civilization), perhaps there are other, more advanced civilizations that can harness all the powers of a star (and these beings would form a Type II civilization). Those organisms may go around colonizing other planets and maybe they simply have not found us yet. They may be observing life on Earth but not directly interfering with it. Another alternative is that these life forms are so advanced that their existence is even past our comprehension. Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku sums it up thusly: \"Let's say we have an anthill in the middle of the forest. And right next to the anthill, they're building a ten-lane superhighway. And the question is, would the ants be able to understand what a ten-lane superhighway is? Would the ants be able to understand the technology and the intentions of the beings building the highway next to them?\" These and other hypotheses abound, and while we may not know now whether there is life in other segments of the universe, we can still endlessly theorize as to the reasons there are or aren't.",

    "passage": "In September 2015, NASA's probes on Mars found strong evidence that the red planet may currently have liquid water, and such a discovery was a source of intense excitement. If liquid water, an ingredient necessary to life on Earth, could be found elsewhere, perhaps life may exist on another planet as well? A discovery that would prove even the existence of unicellular organisms on areas other than Earth would signify a scientific breakthrough and shatter the collective perception of the universe. If the universe is indeed infinite, allowing for an endless permutation of possibilities, then life seems guaranteed to exist. However, scientists on Earth have yet to discover extraterrestrial life. This conundrum is named the Fermi Paradox, named after a physicist who lamented the correlation between the number of planets and our lack of evidence for life in them. Fermi detailed several possibilities for why this might be. For one, perhaps this life exists, but only in the form of microscopic organisms. Another option is that we are in such a remote part of the galaxy that it would be nearly impossible to find anyone else - like looking for a drop of water in a particularly dry region. Perhaps Earth represents the first time life has ever formed in the universe, or even the last. The Fermi Paradox posits yet other explanations. While humans can harness the resources of their host planet (which makes humanity a Type I civilization), perhaps there are other, more advanced civilizations that can harness all the powers of a star (and these beings would form a Type II civilization). Those organisms may go around colonizing other planets and maybe they simply have not found us yet. They may be observing life on Earth but not directly interfering with it. Another alternative is that these life forms are so advanced that their existence is even past our comprehension. Theoretical physicist Michio Kaku sums it up thusly: \"Let's say we have an anthill in the middle of the forest. And right next to the anthill, they're building a ten-lane superhighway. And the question is, would the ants be able to understand what a ten-lane superhighway is? Would the ants be able to understand the technology and the intentions of the beings building the highway next to them?\" These and other hypotheses abound, and while we may not know now whether there is life in other segments of the universe, we can still endlessly theorize as to the reasons there are or aren't.",

    "passage": "The United States Penitentiary in Atlanta is a heavily guarded building. As a medium-security prison, it is surrounded by razor wire fences, which lead out into an open field. A barbed wire fence flanks the open field, which is overseen by a watchtower, and all these factors work together as deterrents for criminals to prevent them from escaping. However, sometimes not even the strictest safety measures can prevent inmates from getting out. One inmate of the penitentiary managed to sneak out of prison grounds, grab a bag full of alcohol and cigarettes, and then return to prison. However, the inmate was caught because the Federal Bureau of Investigation caught him trying to sneak back into jail. Apparently, the prisoner was part of a group who had been sneaking in and out of the prison grounds for years.

An island of the coast of San Francisco, Alcatraz was once a federal prison in the mid-1900s, housing famous outlaws such as Al Capone. One of the difficulties of attempting an escape from the prison was not just because of high-level security measures but also in the geography of the surrounding region. Inmates would have to swim for over a mile to reach land, doing so in an unfamiliar setting and with a short amount of time before search patrols would be sent. San Francisco fog would make navigating the cold waters difficult, and inmates who tried to escape could have injured themselves just by hitting sharp rocks. Late at night on June 11, 1962, a group of convicts created decoys of themselves and then tried to raft to mainland San Francisco. The FBI guesses that the men most likely drowned, potentially suffering from hypothermia.
