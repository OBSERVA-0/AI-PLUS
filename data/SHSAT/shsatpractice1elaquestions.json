    "passage": "YouTube Celebrities\n(1) For many people, the Internet has become a democratizing space in which people can gain information, debate ideas, or find inspiration. (2) One of the most popular platforms to do so is on YouTube, the second most visited website worldwide. (3) YouTube features several channels with content creators who all fill a different niche, meaning there is something for almost every interest. (4) The rise in popularity of the platform has added a new term to our daily vocabulary: the YouTube celebrity. (5) One of the most alluring aspects of working for YouTube is the idea that seemingly anyone can do it. (6) There are users who have managed to make steady income from their YouTube content and were able to quit their day jobs in doing so. (7) This idea inspires lots of people to get started on YouTube. (8) The most popular YouTubers are anomalies, and very few video uploaders attain their level of success. (9) Just like musicians, many YouTube users are subject to the \"one-hit wonder\" phenomenon. (10) This means that just because they produce one work that many people view and share widely does not mean they will be successful overall. (11) Furthermore, with the amount of topics YouTube covers, it is nearly impossible to create a channel that fills a niche that has not already been covered. (12) Something that many new YouTube users also failed to understand is the marketing knowledge and persistence it takes to become successful on YouTube. (13) It can safely be said that in most cases, YouTube celebrities have had a previous channel where they experimented with their videos. (14) These new users learned from their mistakes before finding their \"voice\" and creating a new channel, which is a process that can take years. (15) Many of the pressures of becoming a YouTube celebrity are similar to those associated with becoming any other kind of pop culture celebrity. (16) Once someone has a platform of around a million subscribers, their every word is scrutinized. (17) It is hard to find a topic on YouTube that has not already been covered.

    "passage": "The Eiffel Tower is currently the icon of Paris and one of the most popular destinations in the world, attracting almost 7 million people annually. The iconic tower has inspired many replicas, most notably the one in Las Vegas and the one in Tokyo, with the latter one being even taller than the French original. Despite the ubiquity and appeal of the tower, Parisians were not always open to the idea of having the tower built. Many Paris citizens complained that the tower was ugly, and among those who complained about the aesthetics of the tower were several well-known names in the architectural world. For instance, Charles Garnier, who designed the Paris Opera House, was one of a list of artists, sculptors, and designers who objected to the tower's design when its plan was revealed in the late 19th century. The tower was called a host of unflattering names, among them: \"tragic street lamp,\" \"half-built factory pipe,\" and \"odious column of bolted metal.\" Gustave Eiffel, the civil engineer who is credited for his design of the now-famous tower, had some choice words for his critics. Eiffel responded to the critiques by stating that the tower would be beautiful in its own way due to its mathematical precision. If the number of visitors attracted to a landmark is a measure of success, then Gustave Eiffel ended up winning that debate. Still, there are critics of the Eiffel Tower even in modern times. One of the critiques of the tower is that it gives Americans a false impression that the tower is the center of the city. Another concern is that the tower distracts from other very detailed architectural works in and around Paris, like the Palace of Versailles or Notre Dame. Furthermore, in the same way that very few actual New Yorkers wind up visiting popular tourist sites like the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, few Parisians end up going to the Eiffel Tower because it is such a familiar spot. To Parisians, the area around the Eiffel Tower seems to be overcrowded, overpriced, and a spot where many tourists get scammed.

The iconic tower has inspired many replicas, most notably the one in Las Vegas and the one in Tokyo, with the latter one being even taller than the French original. Despite the ubiquity and appeal of the tower, Parisians were not always open to the idea of having the tower built. Many Paris citizens complained that the tower was ugly, and among those who complained about the aesthetics of the tower were several well-known names in the architectural world. For instance, Charles Garnier, who designed the Paris Opera House, was one of a list of artists, sculptors, and designers who objected to the tower's design when its plan was revealed in the late 19th century. The tower was called a host of unflattering names, among them: \"tragic street lamp,\" \"half-built factory pipe,\" and \"odious column of bolted metal.\" Gustave Eiffel, the civil engineer who is credited for his design of the now-famous tower, had some choice words for his critics. Eiffel responded to the critiques by stating that the tower would be beautiful in its own way due to its mathematical precision. If the number of visitors attracted to a landmark is a measure of success, then Gustave Eiffel ended up winning that debate. Still, there are critics of the Eiffel Tower even in modern times. One of the critiques of the tower is that it gives Americans a false impression that the tower is the center of the city. Another concern is that the tower distracts from other very detailed architectural works in and around Paris, like the Palace of Versailles or Notre Dame. Furthermore, in the same way that very few actual New Yorkers wind up visiting popular tourist sites like the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, few Parisians end up going to the Eiffel Tower because it is such a familiar spot. To Parisians, the area around the Eiffel Tower seems to be overcrowded, overpriced, and a spot where many tourists get scammed. Overall, although visitors worldwide come to see the tower, its design was and still is a topic of controversy.",

    "passage": "One of humanity's greatest accomplishments has been sending a man to the moon. In the 1960s, during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, a period of heightened tension between the two nations, the countries were engaged in something called the Space Race, a period of one-upmanship where each power tried to perform a more impressive astronautical feat than the other. Both countries sent probes to different moons and planets, with Russia claiming to have the first human in space. The United States tried to trump this claim by sending a manned aircraft to the moon. Many animals were sent to space during this time; among them, a monkey blasted off. The monkey, which hitched a ride on a U.S. rocket, was not the first animal in space. United States scientists placed fruit flies in a rocket in 1947 to understand how radiation affects living organisms at that height. The monkey that went to space a year after the fruit flies did not technically enter orbit. This title belonged to a Russian dog named Laika, which was sent into orbit in a satellite in 1957. Although there would probably be ethical objections to such an experiment now, a few decades ago, the Soviet Union determined that dogs, as mammals, would respond to the effects of orbit in a manner similar to that of humans. As adventurous animals, dogs might have been very receptive to the excursion of hopping into a metal aircraft and blasting off to parts unknown. Laika was a particularly attractive candidate to the Soviets because she was a stray dog, which led researchers to believe that she would be resilient under pressure. Small enough to fit into a space capsule and attractive enough to make a pleasing photo subject for newspapers, two-year old Laika was taken from an animal shelter and selected for the mission. Laika died in orbit, but it is not entirely clear what happened to her because of conflicting reports. Russian state media reported that the dog had lived in space for a week, but this is an apocryphal story. It is unlikely that Laika would have been able to survive the incredibly high temperatures caused by the shuttle jetting through the atmosphere.

    "passage": "Suburbs are a relatively recent invention. For the most part, civilization has existed in two realms - the farming sector, which is wide and has a sparse population, as most of the land is used for growing food and tending to livestock, and the urban sector, which is thin and has a dense population, as people converge for work opportunities and seek out people with similar interests. However, there is an in-between to these compartments of civilization: that of the suburbs - an area just outside of an urban region with a large enough population to have amenities but still spread apart enough that the main form of transportation is by car. The first American suburbs, many historians would agree, were in Levittown, a section of Long Island that is 35 miles outside of Manhattan. After World War II, there was a period of economic prosperity in the United States, which strongly helped attract people to suburbs.

    "passage": "Suburbs are a relatively recent invention. For the most part, civilization has existed in two realms - the farming sector, which is wide and has a sparse population, as most of the land is used for growing food and tending to livestock, and the urban sector, which is thin and has a dense population, as people converge for work opportunities and seek out people with similar interests. However, there is an in-between to these compartments of civilization: that of the suburbs - an area just outside of an urban region with a large enough population to have amenities but still spread apart enough that the main form of transportation is by car. The first American suburbs, many historians would agree, were in Levittown, a section of Long Island that is 35 miles outside of Manhattan. After World War II, there was a period of economic prosperity in the United States, which strongly helped attract people to suburbs. Real estate developers created a new type of property by clearing the natural environment and marketing the area as a refuge from city life that was still within driving distance of the city. While modern suburbs are associated with the middle-class, or potential wealth, the opposite was true for Suburra, a suburban area of Rome, Italy that predated Levittown by several centuries. While the modern suburb is associated with cleanliness and space, Suburra was a crowded home for the lower class, housing foreigners and criminals. Interestingly, this rough area was the birthplace of Julius Caesar. The future of suburbs is yet to be determined. Many of them have had steady trickles of emigration as residents move closer to cities for better job opportunities. While parents originally moved into suburbs to flee crime rates found in cities, a general decrease of criminality in the past few decades has also diminished the need for suburbs. Perhaps there will be no need for suburbs at some point and they will become abandoned. However, the future of suburbia may be the inverse - perhaps as cities continue to expand to accommodate growing populations, suburbs will evolve to become incorporated into \"mega-cities\" that can stretch from Boston to Philadelphia.",

    "passage": "For many people, the word \"Africa\" conjures images of mud huts and dust roads. However, the economic growth of Nigeria greatly challenges this image. Nigeria is one of the top 25 countries in terms of its GDP, meaning it outranks First World countries such as Belgium and Sweden. This ranking also makes it the largest economy in Africa. Nigeria has recently surpassed the economy of westernized South Africa, and the country can boast quite a few billionaires. One major contributor to Nigeria's economy is Nollywood - a nickname for the film industry in Nigeria. Nollywood produces more major films annually than the United States does, making it the second most productive country in terms of feature-length films, second only to the market leader of India, which produces over 1,000 productions a year in Mumbai. The economic growth has led to a much higher standard of living in Nigeria than in many other parts of the continent, as well as a large migration of Africans who move to Nigeria for better monetary opportunity. 40% of the Nigerian population has Internet access, and almost two-thirds of Nigerians watch television on a weekly basis. Outside of the cities, the country boasts biodiversity, from swamps to rainforests to rolling hills. Lagos, the most populous city in Nigeria, has plans for an extensive rail system which it plans to add to its current bus transport system. Nigeria even has a neighborhood popular for the upper class, known as Banana Island, which boasts house and rent prices that rival those of the United States. While it is true that the standard of living in Nigeria is an improvement over the standard in certain other areas of Africa, we shouldn't expect a mass of Westerners to migrate there anytime soon.

    "passage": "Multiple other languages greatly influence the English language. Words with many syllables very often have a root found in either Greek or Latin, while much of English grammar and its shorter words are derived from a form of German. There is almost endless debate on how to name something new, and some words we say now may have been different words altogether because of a debate over which languages or meanings to incorporate. Take for instance, the bicycle. When it first hit the mainstream, English speakers referred to the invention as a \"velocipede,\" a term that may be familiar to Russian speakers, who have kept the term as their way of referring to a bicycle. This is not the only example of a name that has changed with time. William Herschel discovered Uranus about 250 years ago, and decided to name it after the reigning ruler of the time - King George III. He specifically referred to it as \"The Georgian Planet\". After time, though, this planet became named 'Uranus' after the Greek deity of the sky. The old name for the month of February was a bit odd. In Old English, February was called Sprout Kale-Monath because it was the month when sea-kale, a type of cabbage, would begin to grow. This would mean that the original name for February could loosely be interpreted as meaning \"Cabbage Month\". There are also accounts of the month being named Solmonath. Interpretations differ, but even though the literal translation is \"mud-month\", historians believe a more accurate meaning is \"month of cake,\" because the Anglo-Saxons would bake food to serve to their gods. Even Vitamin C almost had a strange name. When Hungarian physiologist Albert Szent-Gyorgi discovered Vitamin C, he wasn't entirely sure about the chemical's molecular structure. However, he was convinced that it was a sugar, and as sugars end in -ose (as in the examples of glucose, fructose, and fructose), he called it Godnose, a play on words where the scientist intended to convey that \"God knows what this is made of\".

Words with many syllables very often have a root found in either Greek or Latin, while much of English grammar and its shorter words are derived from a form of German. There is almost endless debate on how to name something new, and some words we say now may have been different words altogether because of a debate over which languages or meanings to incorporate.

    "passage": "When vinyl players first came out, it was thought that they would lead to the death of music. The reality of the situation has been quite different. The reason behind these apocalyptic proclamations was mainly due to the live nature of music - before that time, almost all music was played in-person rather than pre-recorded. Logic at the time dictated that if people could have music in their homes, there would be no sense in seeing musicians perform live. A second perceived end-times of music came when CDs hit the mainstream. It was true that musicians survived with their livelihood despite the advent of vinyl players, and that some artists were even made more popular because their work was available on a vinyl disc, but making music portable surely should have been judgement day for musicians. After all, if someone could take music to their office, car, or barbeque, then what was the purpose of seeing a touring musician? Nonetheless, musicians had largely weathered the storm. The real trouble, however, began when music started to migrate to the online world. Whereas previously, many artists would have been able to sell records and CDs as means of making money that would supplement the income they made from their tours, making music available online actually did decrease profits for musicians. The first such service that provided music to the public, LimeWire, did so for free and illegally, and the creator eventually had to pay a fine of more than $100 million to the Recording Industry Association of America. However, legal platforms created as a form of online radio meant to replace LimeWire, such as Spotify or Pandora, often pay musicians very little for their work. Musicians often must also split industry profits with lawyers, recording agencies, music distributors, venues, and sound engineers, meaning that the amount of money some musicians end up taking at the end of the day is very little unless they manage to be successful while still being entirely independent. There are some factors that could give musicians hope. For one, estimates from different sites speculate that musicians earn an average of $19 per hour - a decent salary that can be grown even more with the proper sales skills. Vinyl players and discs, once thought of as obsolete, are now experiencing a renaissance as music listeners wish to have better sound quality and a physical display of their musical tastes. Singer and songwriter Adele recently made big news when her 2015 album went diamond, meaning that it obtained over 10 million sales in physical copies. While it does seem increasingly difficult for musicians to make a livelihood from their profession, industries and artists will continue to find more effective ways to turn a profit, and reports of the death of the music in the future - if the past is any indicator will be greatly exaggerated.",
