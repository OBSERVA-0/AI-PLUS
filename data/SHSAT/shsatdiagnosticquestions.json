Because schooling is particularly widespread among (5) species of small fish, both theories assume that schooling offers the advantage of some protection from predators.\n\nProponents of theory A dispute the assumption that a school of thousands of fish is highly visible. Experiments have shown that any fish can be seen, (10) even in very clear water, only within a sphere of 200 meters in diameter. When fish are in a compact group, their spheres of visibility overlap. Thus the chance of a predator finding the school is only slightly greater than the chance of the predator (15) finding a single fish swimming alone. Schooling is advantageous to the individual fish because a predator's chance of finding any particular fish swimming in the school is much smaller than its chance of finding at least one of the same group of (20) fish if the fish were dispersed throughout an area.\n\nHowever, opponents of theory A point out that some fish form schools even in areas where predators are abundant and thus little possibility of escaping detection exists. They argue that the school continues (25) to be of value to its members even after detection. They advocate theory B, the \"confusion effect,\" which can be explained in two different ways.\n\nSometimes, proponents argue, predators simply cannot decide which fish to attack.

In many schools the fish are almost identical in appearance, making it difficult for a predator to select one. The second explanation for (35) the \"confusion effect\" has to do with the sensory confusion caused by a large number of prey moving around the predator. Even if the predator makes the decision to attack a particular fish, the movement of other prey in the school can be distracting.

        "passage": "Biologists have advanced two theories to explain why schooling of fish occurs in so many fish species. Because schooling is particularly widespread among (5) species of small fish, both theories assume that schooling offers the advantage of some protection from predators.\n\nProponents of theory A dispute the assumption that a school of thousands of fish is highly visible. Experiments have shown that any fish can be seen, (10) even in very clear water, only within a sphere of 200 meters in diameter. When fish are in a compact group, their spheres of visibility overlap. Thus the chance of a predator finding the school is only slightly greater than the chance of the predator (15) finding a single fish swimming alone. Schooling is advantageous to the individual fish because a predator's chance of finding any particular fish swimming in the school is much smaller than its chance of finding at least one of the same group of (20) fish if the fish were dispersed throughout an area.\n\nHowever, opponents of theory A point out that some fish form schools even in areas where predators are abundant and thus little possibility of escaping detection exists. They argue that the school continues (25) to be of value to its members even after detection. They advocate theory B, the \"confusion effect,\" which can be explained in two different ways.\n\nSometimes, proponents argue, predators simply cannot decide which fish to attack. This indecision (30) supposedly results from a predator's preference for striking prey that is distinct from the rest of the school in appearance. In many schools the fish are almost identical in appearance, making it difficult for a predator to select one. The second explanation for (35) the \"confusion effect\" has to do with the sensory confusion caused by a large number of prey moving around the predator. Even if the predator makes the decision to attack a particular fish, the movement of other prey in the school can be distracting. The (40) predator's difficulty can be compared to that of a tennis player trying to hit a tennis ball when two are approaching simultaneously.",

        "passage": "Is a College Education Worth It?\n\nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 2004 the unemployment rate for adults (5) aged 25 years and older who had not completed high school was 8.5 percent. For those who had completed high school, the rate was 5.0 percent. But for those with bachelor's degrees, the number was just 2.7 percent. In other words, those without a college degree were nearly twice as likely to (10) experience unemployment.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, college degree holders earn on average double the annual salary of someone with just a high school diploma. And if the size of your monthly paycheck isn't (15) enough to motivate you to get your degree, consider this: Over an adult's working life, high school graduates earn an average of $1.2 million; associate's degree holders earn about $1.6 million; and bachelor's degree holders earn about $2.1 million. (20) Those are some serious differences.\n\nThe Institute's 1998 report lists encouraging demographic statistics for college graduates. For example, many with college degrees have priceless health benefits such as longer life expectancy. People (25) with four-year degrees smoke less and tend to make better consumer choices to benefit their health and lifestyle. Even more important to many parents who are considering going back to school, kids raised by parents with college degrees are more likely to (30) graduate high school and go on to college. And teenage daughters of college grads are less likely to become unwed mothers.\n\nThe salary, employment, and fringe benefits that college graduates enjoy allow the unexpected benefit (35) of the fun factor. Because college graduates have a higher disposable income and get more vacation time, they're more likely to visit amusement parks and art museums, attend sporting events, and go hiking and camping. They also tend to read more, (40) and for many people that is fun in and of itself.\n\nWhile having better benefits, more money, and more leisure time are surely very valuable reasons to get your college degree, there are many intangible reasons why pursuing a degree is worthwhile. For (45) example, you will have the satisfaction of learning more about things that interest you and expanding your knowledge and skills. It's unlikely that most college students think about the rewards of their studies in these terms, but these perks are greatly (50) appreciated after graduation. When graduates were asked, several years after college, to list the benefits of their college education, most name higher pay and a rich intellectual life. What most people do not realize until much later, however, is that higher education (55) means living a longer and healthier life.\n\nMortality rates for Americans ages 25 to 64 who have attended college are less than half the rates for those who stopped education after completing high school. In 1999, the most recent year for which final (60) mortality rates have been published, there were 219 deaths per 100,000 people per year for those with 13 or more years of education, compared with 474 per 100,000 for those with 12 years, and 585 per 100,000 for those with fewer than 12 years of education. These (65) differences are somewhat greater for men than for women.\n\nThe mortality advantage for Americans with higher education has been growing in recent decades, according to several studies that used census and (70) survey data. And there is an added advantage for educated people in rates of illness and disability, so that those with some college education enjoy extra years of healthy life.

In other words, those without a college degree were nearly twice as likely to (10) experience unemployment.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, college degree holders earn on average double the annual salary of someone with just a high school diploma. And if the size of your monthly paycheck isn't (15) enough to motivate you to get your degree, consider this: Over an adult's working life, high school graduates earn an average of $1.2 million; associate's degree holders earn about $1.6 million; and bachelor's degree holders earn about $2.1 million. (20) Those are some serious differences.\n\nThe Institute's 1998 report lists encouraging demographic statistics for college graduates. For example, many with college degrees have priceless health benefits such as longer life expectancy. People (25) with four-year degrees smoke less and tend to make better consumer choices to benefit their health and lifestyle. Even more important to many parents who are considering going back to school, kids raised by parents with college degrees are more likely to (30) graduate high school and go on to college. And teenage daughters of college grads are less likely to become unwed mothers.\n\nThe salary, employment, and fringe benefits that college graduates enjoy allow the unexpected benefit (35) of the fun factor. Because college graduates have a higher disposable income and get more vacation time, they're more likely to visit amusement parks and art museums, attend sporting events, and go hiking and camping. They also tend to read more, (40) and for many people that is fun in and of itself.\n\nWhile having better benefits, more money, and more leisure time are surely very valuable reasons to get your college degree, there are many intangible reasons why pursuing a degree is worthwhile. For (45) example, you will have the satisfaction of learning more about things that interest you and expanding your knowledge and skills. It's unlikely that most college students think about the rewards of their studies in these terms, but these perks are greatly (50) appreciated after graduation. When graduates were asked, several years after college, to list the benefits of their college education, most name higher pay and a rich intellectual life. What most people do not realize until much later, however, is that higher education (55) means living a longer and healthier life.\n\nMortality rates for Americans ages 25 to 64 who have attended college are less than half the rates for those who stopped education after completing high school. In 1999, the most recent year for which final (60) mortality rates have been published, there were 219 deaths per 100,000 people per year for those with 13 or more years of education, compared with 474 per 100,000 for those with 12 years, and 585 per 100,000 for those with fewer than 12 years of education. These (65) differences are somewhat greater for men than for women.\n\nThe mortality advantage for Americans with higher education has been growing in recent decades, according to several studies that used census and (70) survey data. And there is an added advantage for educated people in rates of illness and disability, so that those with some college education enjoy extra years of healthy life. Two factors that partly explain the education advantage are lifestyle (educated people (75) are less likely to smoke or engage in other risky behaviors) and health insurance (people with more education tend to have better coverage than those with less education).",
