    "passage": "William Shakespeare \n(1) Even though he's been dead more than 400 years, William Shakespeare remains one of the most famous Englishmen in history. (2) He also remains one of the most widely read authors in the world, and his plays are still performed regularly. (3) Although much of the details of his personal life are lost to history, his 38 plays and 154 sonnets suggest that Shakespeare was a sensitive, witty man filled with love for life and language. (4) Many of his most famous plays and poems are still taught in schools around the world, so most people have at least some experience reading Shakespeare. (5) Shakespeare's comedies often dealt with cases of mistaken identity, including situations where poor characters were mistaken for rich characters and female characters were mistaken for male characters. (6) To Shakespeare's audience, these storylines were funny because the social structure of the time was very rigid, and there was a common belief that people needed to know and stay in their place. (7) Shakespeare also explored how human flaws and weaknesses can create sadness and misery in his tragedies. (8) The main characters in Shakespeare's tragedies were generally short-sighted, vain, jealous, or mean spirited, and those traits most often lead to their death or ruin. (9) Shakespeare's histories told romanticized versions of the lives of the English monarchs, which gave his audience a sense of history and national pride at a time when many common people could not read. (10) Many of Shakespeare's plays were originally performed for the first time in London's Globe Theatre, which was built in 1599.

    "passage": "Excerpt from \"The Lumber Room\" by H.H. Munro \nOften and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the lumber-room might be like, that region that was so carefully sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were ever answered. It came up to his expectations. In the first place it was large and dimly lit, one high window opening onto the forbidden garden being its only source of illumination. In the second place it was a storehouse of unimagined treasures. The aunt-by-assertion was one of those people who think that things spoil by use and consign them to dust and damp by way of preserving them. Such parts of the house as Nicholas knew best were rather bare and cheerless, but here there were wonderful things for the eye to feast on. First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry that was evidently meant to be a fire· screen. To Nicholas it was a living, breathing story; he sat down on a roll of Indian hangings, glowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust, and took in all the details of the tapestry picture. A man, dressed in the hunting costume of some remote period, had just transfixed a stag with an arrow; it could not have been a difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces away from him; in the thickly growing vegetation that the picture suggested it would not have been dif f icult to creep up to a feeding stag, and the two spotted dogs that were springing forward to join in the chase had evidently been trained to keep to heel till the arrow was discharged. That part of the picture was simple, if interesting, but did the huntsman see, what Nicholas saw, that four galloping wolves were coming in his direction through the wood? There might be more than four of them hidden behind the trees, and in any case would the man and his dogs be able to cope with the four wolves if they made an attack? The man had only two arrows lef t in his quiver, and he might miss with one or both of them; all one knew about his skill in shooting was that he could hit a Large stag at a ridiculously short range. Nicholas sat for many golden minutes revolving the possibilities of the scene; he was inclined to think that there were more than four wolves and that the man and his dogs were in a tight corner. But there were other objects of delight and interest claiming his instant attention; there were quaint twisted candlesticks in the shape of snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come. How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! And there was a carved sandalwood box packed tight with aromatic cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to see and to handle. Less promising in appearance was a Large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured pictures of Go birds. And such birds! In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeons here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures.",

    "passage": "Excerpt from \"The Lumber Room\" by H.H. Munro \nOften and often Nicholas had pictured to himself what the lumber-room might be like, that region that was so carefully sealed from youthful eyes and concerning which no questions were ever answered. It came up to his expectations. In the first place it was large and dimly lit, one high window opening onto the forbidden garden being its only source of illumination. In the second place it was a storehouse of unimagined treasures. The aunt-by-assertion was one of those people who think that things spoil by use and consign them to dust and damp by way of preserving them. Such parts of the house as Nicholas knew best were rather bare and cheerless, but here there were wonderful things for the eye to feast on. First and foremost there was a piece of framed tapestry that was evidently meant to be a fire· screen. To Nicholas it was a living, breathing story; he sat down on a roll of Indian hangings, glowing in wonderful colours beneath a layer of dust, and took in all the details of the tapestry picture. A man, dressed in the hunting costume of some remote period, had just transfixed a stag with an arrow; it could not have been a difficult shot because the stag was only one or two paces away from him; in the thickly growing vegetation that the picture suggested it would not have been dif f icult to creep up to a feeding stag, and the two spotted dogs that were springing forward to join in the chase had evidently been trained to keep to heel till the arrow was discharged. That part of the picture was simple, if interesting, but did the huntsman see, what Nicholas saw, that four galloping wolves were coming in his direction through the wood? There might be more than four of them hidden behind the trees, and in any case would the man and his dogs be able to cope with the four wolves if they made an attack? The man had only two arrows lef t in his quiver, and he might miss with one or both of them; all one knew about his skill in shooting was that he could hit a Large stag at a ridiculously short range. Nicholas sat for many golden minutes revolving the possibilities of the scene; he was inclined to think that there were more than four wolves and that the man and his dogs were in a tight corner. But there were other objects of delight and interest claiming his instant attention; there were quaint twisted candlesticks in the shape of snakes, and a teapot fashioned like a china duck, out of whose open beak the tea was supposed to come. How dull and shapeless the nursery teapot seemed in comparison! And there was a carved sandalwood box packed tight with aromatic cotton-wool, and between the layers of cotton-wool were little brass figures, hump-necked bulls, and peacocks and goblins, delightful to see and to handle. Less promising in appearance was a Large square book with plain black covers; Nicholas peeped into it, and, behold, it was full of coloured pictures of Go birds. And such birds! In the garden, and in the lanes when he went for a walk, Nicholas came across a few birds, of which the largest were an occasional magpie or wood-pigeons here were herons and bustards, kites, toucans, tiger-bitterns, brush turkeys, ibises, golden pheasants, a whole portrait gallery of undreamed-of creatures.",

    "passage": "The Communist Manifesto\nIt's hard to argue that any publication was more influential or talked-about than The Communist Manifesto between 1850 and 2000. At under 50 pages, the text of the Manifesto is brief, but it contains ideas so powerful and controversial that much of the twentieth century became a struggle between those who agreed and disagreed with what it said. Its authors, the German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, wrote the Manifesto to reflect the beliefs of the Communist League, a European political party they both belonged to that rejected the traditional social and governmental order of the world. Essentially, The Communist Manifesto had two main themes: class struggle and proper land usage. The former is better remembered today, but the latter was also crucial to Marx and Engels' original vision. The Manifesto claimed that all history was a series of cycles of struggle related to social class. Marx and Engels essentially believed that every society or form of government to date had been about establishing a social order in which a few people had all the wealth, status, and property at the expense of the masses, who had to do most of the real work with minimal reward. Eventually, the masses would organize and overthrow these oppressive regimes, but a new one would rise just as quickly. Although many at the time believed the growth of capitalism had eliminated or lessened these inequalities, Marx and Engels believed it was just the same game of haves and have-nots under a new name. Instead, they sought to propose a different way of doing things. The Communist Manifesto was their way of articulating how they believed a perfect society that valued equality, fairness, and the common good would function. One of the key pillars of their proposed society was the abolition of private property. They believed all land and materials should belong to the group as a whole and be distributed in a way that ensured everyone's needs were met. In short, there would be no rich people and no poor people. Marx and Engels also wanted to ensure that land was put to use in a way that benefitted all, not just some. They believed that large, government-run farms should grow food to feed all the people in a way that make sure everyone could eat and no stores were over-charging people for food. They also thought the government should build factories and other facilities that would provide people with work and a way to contribute meaningfully to their society. Basically, the Communist League believed that nobody should be born powerful through inheritance or able to obtain enough money to use it to create an unfair advantage or manipulate people. This was one of the most controversial ideas in the entire Manifesto because Europe (and much of the rest of the world) had traditionally been ruled by aristocrats and successful business owners, neither of whom were eager to suddenly have less money or influence. Marx and Engels were essentially calling for regular working class people, who had formed a silent global majority for millennia, to rise up and take power away from the elites who had traditionally run the world. The Manifesto's final line, 'Workers of the world, unite!' was a scary call to action for the rich and powerful of the late nineteenth century.\nThroughout the twentieth century, many countries became Communist states. In 1917, there was an uprising in Russia, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Soviet Union or U.S.S.R. The Soviet Union, which was built on the ideals of The Communist Manifesto, would grow into one of the great super powers of the 1900s. China, Cuba, and Vietnam all became Communist countries as well, although in each case, there were bloody revolutions where many people lost their lives. Ultimately, all these countries failed to accomplish the perfectly fair, equal society outlined by Marx and Engels. The challenge of using public land and communal farms to feed the entire population, for example, proved challenging in almost every attempt, and there were frequently famines in Communist countries. Even though the vision of The Communist Manifesto was never fully realized, it remains one of the most important texts in recent history.",

    "passage": "The Communist Manifesto\nIt's hard to argue that any publication was more influential or talked-about than The Communist Manifesto between 1850 and 2000. At under 50 pages, the text of the Manifesto is brief, but it contains ideas so powerful and controversial that much of the twentieth century became a struggle between those who agreed and disagreed with what it said. Its authors, the German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, wrote the Manifesto to reflect the beliefs of the Communist League, a European political party they both belonged to that rejected the traditional social and governmental order of the world. Essentially, The Communist Manifesto had two main themes: class struggle and proper land usage. The former is better remembered today, but the latter was also crucial to Marx and Engels' original vision. The Manifesto claimed that all history was a series of cycles of struggle related to social class. Marx and Engels essentially believed that every society or form of government to date had been about establishing a social order in which a few people had all the wealth, status, and property at the expense of the masses, who had to do most of the real work with minimal reward. Eventually, the masses would organize and overthrow these oppressive regimes, but a new one would rise just as quickly. Although many at the time believed the growth of capitalism had eliminated or lessened these inequalities, Marx and Engels believed it was just the same game of haves and have-nots under a new name. Instead, they sought to propose a different way of doing things. The Communist Manifesto was their way of articulating how they believed a perfect society that valued equality, fairness, and the common good would function. One of the key pillars of their proposed society was the abolition of private property. They believed all land and materials should belong to the group as a whole and be distributed in a way that ensured everyone's needs were met. In short, there would be no rich people and no poor people. Marx and Engels also wanted to ensure that land was put to use in a way that benefitted all, not just some. They believed that large, government-run farms should grow food to feed all the people in a way that make sure everyone could eat and no stores were over-charging people for food. They also thought the government should build factories and other facilities that would provide people with work and a way to contribute meaningfully to their society. Basically, the Communist League believed that nobody should be born powerful through inheritance or able to obtain enough money to use it to create an unfair advantage or manipulate people. This was one of the most controversial ideas in the entire Manifesto because Europe (and much of the rest of the world) had traditionally been ruled by aristocrats and successful business owners, neither of whom were eager to suddenly have less money or influence. Marx and Engels were essentially calling for regular working class people, who had formed a silent global majority for millennia, to rise up and take power away from the elites who had traditionally run the world. The Manifesto's final line, 'Workers of the world, unite!' was a scary call to action for the rich and powerful of the late nineteenth century.\nThroughout the twentieth century, many countries became Communist states. In 1917, there was an uprising in Russia, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Soviet Union or U.S.S.R. The Soviet Union, which was built on the ideals of The Communist Manifesto, would grow into one of the great super powers of the 1900s. China, Cuba, and Vietnam all became Communist countries as well, although in each case, there were bloody revolutions where many people lost their lives. Ultimately, all these countries failed to accomplish the perfectly fair, equal society outlined by Marx and Engels. The challenge of using public land and communal farms to feed the entire population, for example, proved challenging in almost every attempt, and there were frequently famines in Communist countries. Even though the vision of The Communist Manifesto was never fully realized, it remains one of the most important texts in recent history.",

    "passage": "Brewing\nOne of the most misunderstood and misused products in this country is beer. It's hard to watch a sports game or late night TV show without seeing several commercials for various brands of beer. Beer, however, is so much more than a drink for adults at cookouts; it's a beverage that was crucial to human history and the development of the way we live today. The process of creating beer, known as brewing, has been handed down and refined for more than 6,000 years. This makes brewing a fascinating combination of science, art, and social impact.\nFor millennia, brewers have made beer using the same basic steps, although technology and innovation have refined the process over time. Beer has four basic ingredients: water, malted grain, yeast, and hops. First, brewers boil the grain in the water to extract starches and sugars. This creates a sweet Liquid known as \"wort.\" Hops, which look like small green pinecones, are added to the wort to mellow out the sweetness and add piney or citrusy bitter flavors. Then, the wort is cooled to room temperature and the brewers add yeast, which begins the process of fermentation. Brewer's yeast contains millions of single-celled microscopic fungi that consume the sugar and oxygen within the wort and convert them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process goes on for several days, gradually transforming the wort into something known as \"green beer.\" Green beer is almost finished but often contains bizarre off-flavors like bubble gum or cotton candy. To clean up these undesirable tastes, brewers cool the green beer to begin a process known as \"conditioning.\" During conditioning, most of the yeast goes dormant and falls to the bottom of the tank, where it can be poured off. Meanwhile, the small amount of very strong yeast that survived the temperature drop goes to work reconsuming the off-flavors. After several more days, the beer can be filtered and placed into bottles, kegs, or cans for storage.\nToday, most people associate beer with adults having a barbecue or watching a sports game, but brewing has been vitally important to civilization in many different ways throughout history. Brewing was one of the innovations that made it safer for people to populate in cities around shared water sources. Drinking downstream from a bustling, over-populated town or drawing water from a village well people threw trash into could easily make someone deathly ill. Beer, however, was free from most of the bacteria and germs within the water because the wort had been boiled. The completed product stayed fresh and safe to consume for weeks because of the natural preservative quality of alcohol. In this way, beer was actually crucial to public health.\nIn medieval Europe, for example, sanitation was so poor and water-borne disease so prevalent that the Catholic Church actively discouraged their monks, priests, and nuns from drinking water. In response, the monasteries and abbeys where these religious communities lived became some of the first large-scale brewing operations. Initially, the brewer monks created just enough beer for their own needs and those of the religious communities around them, but soon they learned they could support their lifestyle financially and aid the health their flocks by selling their beer to taverns and alehouses where local laypeople could drink safe, nourishing beer as well.\nToday, tens of millions of people of diverse cultures around the world enjoy beer each day. Unfortunately, however, our society often fails to contextualize beer properly, which has led to many people over-indulging or acting irresponsibly or dangerously as a result. If more folks understood the complex, artisanal process of brewing and beer's true origins as a means to preserve clean water, perhaps there would be more respect for the process and less emphasis on the intoxicating qualities of alcohol.",

    "passage": "Brewing\nOne of the most misunderstood and misused products in this country is beer. It's hard to watch a sports game or late night TV show without seeing several commercials for various brands of beer. Beer, however, is so much more than a drink for adults at cookouts; it's a beverage that was crucial to human history and the development of the way we live today. The process of creating beer, known as brewing, has been handed down and refined for more than 6,000 years. This makes brewing a fascinating combination of science, art, and social impact.\nFor millennia, brewers have made beer using the same basic steps, although technology and innovation have refined the process over time. Beer has four basic ingredients: water, malted grain, yeast, and hops. First, brewers boil the grain in the water to extract starches and sugars. This creates a sweet Liquid known as \"wort.\" Hops, which look like small green pinecones, are added to the wort to mellow out the sweetness and add piney or citrusy bitter flavors. Then, the wort is cooled to room temperature and the brewers add yeast, which begins the process of fermentation. Brewer's yeast contains millions of single-celled microscopic fungi that consume the sugar and oxygen within the wort and convert them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This process goes on for several days, gradually transforming the wort into something known as \"green beer.\" Green beer is almost finished but often contains bizarre off-flavors like bubble gum or cotton candy. To clean up these undesirable tastes, brewers cool the green beer to begin a process known as \"conditioning.\" During conditioning, most of the yeast goes dormant and falls to the bottom of the tank, where it can be poured off. Meanwhile, the small amount of very strong yeast that survived the temperature drop goes to work reconsuming the off-flavors. After several more days, the beer can be filtered and placed into bottles, kegs, or cans for storage.\nToday, most people associate beer with adults having a barbecue or watching a sports game, but brewing has been vitally important to civilization in many different ways throughout history. Brewing was one of the innovations that made it safer for people to populate in cities around shared water sources. Drinking downstream from a bustling, over-populated town or drawing water from a village well people threw trash into could easily make someone deathly ill. Beer, however, was free from most of the bacteria and germs within the water because the wort had been boiled. The completed product stayed fresh and safe to consume for weeks because of the natural preservative quality of alcohol.

    "passage": "Classifying Soil Types\nMany people mistakenly assume that dirt is dirt. However, if you're attempting to farm, garden, or maintain a beautiful yard, understanding your soil type is fundamental. Different soil types have different strengths, present different challenges, and demand different techniques. Understanding the soil in your yard or garden could be the difference between seeing bountiful, beautiful growth and feeling like you can't grow anything.\nThe best way to understand soil in general is to understand what the ideal soil is like. The best type of soil for growing most plants, flowers, and crops is loamy soil. Loamy soil is very dark in color (even appearing black when freshly tilled) and has a flaky or crumbly appearance, but if you press it together in your hands when it's crumbly, it should form a clump that holds its shape. That means that there's enough structure below ground to keep the plant safely anchored and provide structure for its root system but also enough plasticity to allow roots to spread out to find more water and nutrients.\nOn the other hand, sandy soil presents some challenges for plants and gardeners. As its name implies, sandy soil is made of big, dry, grainy particles. That means that water filters down through sandy soil extremely quickly, carrying it away from plants and their roots before they can get their fill. On the plus side, warming sunlight penetrates sandy soil more quickly than other types, which means that many of the first flowers and greens of the spring grow nicely in sandy soil.\nClay soil lies at the exact opposite end of the spectrum. It's tight, clumpy, and damp by nature. Its moisture-holding qualities make clay soil an extremely nutritious environment for plants, but its density means a short growing season, as spring and autumn frosts make the soil cold, hard, and uninviting for roots. If you wait too late into the summer to till your clay soil and allow it to dry out, though, getting your plants in the ground will be an incredible workout.\nIf you live in a desert-adjacent climate or near the ocean, you might have saline soil. Saline soil has a lot of salt in it, and salt's disagreeable relationship with water means that saline salt will make it tough for your plants and their roots to achieve full potential. Some plants won't even grow in saline soil! Unless you're satisfied to cultivate plants that naturally grow in desert-like environments, growing in a saline-rich environment means amending your soil with nutrients.\nSilty soil is usually found near rivers, streams, ponds, swamps, and other bodies of fresh water. The consistency of silty soil is between that of sand and clay, which gives it a clumpy but slick feel. Plants can grow rapidly in silty soil because it is so rich in water and nutrients, but that often means shallow root systems that can cause plants to collapse easily under their own weight as they grow. Plants that grow in silty soil are also prone to getting washed out when the soil gets overly wet.\nFinally, there's peat. Peat is somewhat similar to loam in that it is dark, holds water well, and is naturally loaded with nutrients. Peat contains the remains of ancient plants that were destroyed by glaciers, so it's almost like supporting your plants by feeding them concentrated plant food. However, peat is extremely prone to fluctuations in acidity that can suddenly kill even healthy-looking plants. That means that gardening with peat requires careful pH monitoring and frequent check-ins.",

However, peat is extremely prone to fluctuations in acidity that can suddenly kill even healthy-looking plants. That means that gardening with peat requires careful pH monitoring and frequent check-ins.",

    "passage": "Epic Poetry\nThese days, the word \"epic\" is used to mean \"really cool'' or \"exciting and memorable,\" but until recently, the word had a very specific, scholarly meaning. In the world of literature and academia, an \"epic\" is an especially long poem that contains a grandiose story. An epic is written in verse and meter, like traditional poetry, but follows the adventures and evolution of a main character, as we would expect from a novel. Many of the earliest recorded stories we know about are in the form of epics, such as The Epic of Gilgamesh, which was written about 4,000 years ago and may be the earliest recorded long form story.\nThe most famous creator of epics is undeniably Homer, a bard who wandered throughout what is now Greece and Turkey at some point between the twelfth and eighth centuries BC. Homer combined existing myths with narratives about famous warriors and kings to create a new form of literature, which we now refer to as the epic. The father of the epic wasn't just a writer, though; he was a performer who knew his incredibly long poems by heart and could recite them from memory over the course of hours. Some historical texts even suggest Homer may have been blind. On the other hand, however, other scholars believe the name \"Homer\" was a collective pseudonym used by a variety of ancient storytellers and no single author is responsible for the ancient Greek epics.\nHomer's most famous works are The Iliad and The Odyssey, which are known as the \"Homeric Epics.\" The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan War, in which the Greeks and their allies sailed to Troy (in modern Turkey) to reclaim their kidnapped queen, Helen. The Iliad isn't just a cut-and-dried battle story though, it involves serious reflections on the purpose of warfare and the need for diplomacy between enemies. The Iliad also established one of the conventions of epic poetry: the constant intercession of gods or other higher beings. In the epic, the Greek gods divide into two teams, one supporting the Greeks and one supporting the Trojans. The gods are portrayed not just as creators or observers, but active participants in the war. The second Homeric Epic, The Odyssey is effectively a sequel to The Iliad and follows the long journey of Odysseus, a Greek king who fought in the Trojan War, as he tries to make his way back home after fighting. Due to some strategic mistakes early in his voyage, Odysseus must wander the seas for ten years before finally returning home.\nIn the subsequent millennia, Homer has served as an inspiration to many authors and poets. For example, the English author and politician John Milton crafted two major epics, Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, in the 1600s, both of which were highly imitative of Homer's style. Although few people are sitting around writing epic poems today, the tradition of the epic is still on display in many great movies and television shows. Any time you see a main character who faces impossible challenge after impossible challenge each episode, that's an example of epic storytelling. When characters must seek revenge for wrongs done against their family or friends, that's epic storytelling. The next time you hear something described as \"epic,\" think about how that experience, story, or event connects to the legacy of Homer and the genre he made legendary.",
