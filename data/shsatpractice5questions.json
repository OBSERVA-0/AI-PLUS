        "passage": "The following excerpt, from Mark Twain's 1876 The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, details Tom's first encounter with a new neighbor.\n\nTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward (5) the public square of the village, where two \"military\" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two (10) great commanders did not condescend to fight in person-that being better suited to the still smaller fry-but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's (15) army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the (20) armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\n\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden-a lovely little blue-eyed (25) creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes¹. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory (35) of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning (40) her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.\n\n(45) He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to \"show off\" in all sorts of absurd boyish (50) ways, in order to win her admiration.

He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward (5) the public square of the village, where two \"military\" companies of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two (10) great commanders did not condescend to fight in person-that being better suited to the still smaller fry-but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp. Tom's (15) army won a great victory, after a long and hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the (20) armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.\n\nAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new girl in the garden-a lovely little blue-eyed (25) creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered pantalettes¹. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory (35) of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality. He had been months winning (40) her; she had confessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.\n\n(45) He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and began to \"show off\" in all sorts of absurd boyish (50) ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced (55) aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a (60) moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.\n\n(65) The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction. Presently he (70) picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested upon it, (75) his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a minute-only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next his heart-or next his stomach, possibly, (80) for he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.\n\nHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, \"showing off,\" as before; but the girl never exhibited (85) herself again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.\n\n¹undergarments that cover the legs",

        "passage": "Many contemporary scientists believe that the universe began in a giant explosion, or \"big bang.\" At least ten billion years ago, they surmise, a state (5) of extremely high temperature and pressure caused the universe to expand rapidly from a compressed state. Soon after, there was significant cooling, and at this point there were probably many types of elementary particles present. As further cooling occurred, the first (10) nuclei were formed. Gradually, over millions of years, the universe began to take on the characteristics that we observe today.\n\nOne of the major assumptions upon (15) which the big bang theory is dependent is called the cosmological principle. This principle states that our observations of general properties of the universe do not depend on our location or the direction in which we look. Based on this assump- (20) tion, scientists believe that the explosion known as the big bang occurred not at any particular point, but instantaneously throughout space.\n\nEvidence to support the big bang (25) theory comes mainly from observations of galaxies out beyond our Milky Way. These galaxies are so far away that, by the time light reaches us from there, millions of years have passed. Distant objects are seen as they ap- (30) peared when the light we receive first left them, providing us with a picture of the early universe.\n\nIn addition, the discovery of weak radiation has given support to the big bang (35) theory of the origin of the universe.

When the universe was only (50) one or two minutes old, it was much too hot to make Helium-4.

        "passage": "The perception of canis lupus, the wild wolf, as humanity's great antagonist is one that pervades Western literature. It is canis lupus who dispossesses (5) the Three Little Pigs, who devours Little Red Riding Hood's granny, and who eventually shows up after Peter cried \"wolf!\" too many times. This image likely originated in the Middle Ages. During the Black Plague, (10) human cultivation of herd animals-sheep, cattle, and the like-came to a standstill. Ravenous wolves, no longer able to stalk their traditional prey (herd animals), turned their attentions to human beings. Men soon came to (15) see the wolf as \"the Devil, red-tongued, sulfur-breathed, and yellow-eyed.\"\n\nIronically, canis lupus and humans have lived together, usually peacefully, for two million years since the wolf evolved to (20) its present form. About 13,000 years ago, Paleolithic hunter-gatherers bred wolves as domestic dogs, canis familiaris. Why wolves? We can't say for sure. There are (25) all kinds of possibilities. One prevalent view today posits that wolves gathered around the Paleolithic humans' campsite looking for food. Some wolves may have been less frightened and more willing to approach closely. Through natural (30) selection these wolves' offspring were the first steps of the wolves' evolution into dogs.\n\nBut why did the humans welcome the dogs? Perhaps our ancestors admired the beast's power, intelligence, (35) and social interactions. The wolf pack, say many biologists, is just a more primitive version of the human hunter-gatherer social structure. They have a community in which it is their social interdependence that aids them all in (40) survival. Sound familiar?\n\nPeople may have domesticated the wolf also because of wolves' expressiveness. Through body language and facial expressions, wolves communicate their (45) moods, from anger and aggression to happiness and submission. Early humans surely picked up on the signals, just as the wolves probably picked up on the humans' own methods of communication. Domestication may have (50) been a natural step once the two species had developed a way to understand one another's moods.\n\nTo capture their prey, wolves use tactics so similar to those of hunter-gatherer teams that anthropologists suspect early (55) humans learned to track large animals by watching wolves do the same. Wolves may \"appoint\" one pack member as a decoy who will lunge at and run around the prey. This allows the rest of the pack (60) to take its victim by surprise. Wolf packs may also form two teams, one to stampede its prey toward the other. In these and other ways, the wolves use their various strengths to achieve success as a group. Some may be physically power- (65) ful, some watchful and clever, but if the pack is successful all will sleep with a full belly by nightfall.\n\nThese theories ring true to anyone who has a dog today. After all, all modern (70) dogs (no matter how different they seem from the wolf) communicate in the same way as do wolves, and a family's pet dog becomes a member of the \"pack,\" just as those first domesticated wolves must (75) have done thousands of years ago.",

The outstanding achievement was basing chemistry on sound, precise, quantitative (5) measurement. The balance, symbol of the modern chemist of the late 1700s, enabled chemists to substitute precise weights for the crude approximations of the medieval alchemist.\n\nThis refined approach helped lead to a (10) number of important discoveries. One of the most significant was the clarification of the distinction between a true chemical reaction and the mere process of mixing. This distinction had been dimly (15) perceived before; mixtures displayed a blend of the properties of their components, depending on the relative proportions making up the mixture. A chemical (20) reaction, however, might produce a substance totally unlike the materials that went into its formation. For example, common water arises from the union of two gases: oxygen and hydrogen. Similarly, the putty-like metal sodium reacts (25) with the green gas chlorine to form ordinary table salt. But the explanation for the difference seemed hazy until the analytic balance revealed the key. By careful weighing, chemists found that (30) mixtures could be formed in any desired proportions, but chemical reactions were produced by an exact recipe. The constituents had to be present in some exact proportion of weight; if the proportions (35) were not exact, less of the resultant substance was produced.\n\nFinally, the founders of modern chemistry clarified yet another distinction between types of substances. They classified some as elements, which could not (40) be broken down into other substances, and others as compounds, which could. The whole picture was terribly inviting to an atomist. All one needed to do was identify the elements as representing (45) the different kinds of atoms, chemical compounds as substances formed by attaching atoms of different elements together, and mixtures as a free mingling of independent atoms without any ties between them. But atomism, (50) and indeed the whole intellectual style of imaginary model building that lay behind it, was mainly the province of physicists. One such, the Italian Amedeo Avogadro, pushed the atomic idea in chemistry well before the end of (55) the eighteenth century. But while his arguments satisfied many of his own colleagues, the vast majority of chemists remained skeptical of such wild talk. Throughout its history, chemistry (60) has tended to be a far more conservative science than physics, sticking close to its empirical roots and disdaining abstractions and speculations.
