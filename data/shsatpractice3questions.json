        "passage": "The question of why dinosaurs became extinct has puzzled paleontologists since the first dinosaur fossil was found almost two centuries ago. These great reptiles dominated the Earth for almost 160 million (5) years, but mysteriously died out approximately 65 million years ago. Various explanations for this disappearance have been offered, ranging from an epidemic to a sudden, catastrophic drop in temperature. But no theory has yet been conclusively proven.\n\n(10) In 1980, Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, suggested a new explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs. According to Luis Alvarez and his geologist son Walter, a huge meteor crashed into the Earth's surface 65 million years ago, sending up a (15) massive cloud of dust and rock particles. The cloud blocked out sunlight for a period of months or even years, disrupting plant growth and the global food chain. The lack of plants as a food source, coupled with a significant drop in temperature, resulted in the (20) extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nAlvarez based his theory on an unusual piece of evidence. Geologists discovered that a thin layer of the metal iridium had been deposited all over the world at approximately the time the dinosaurs died out. Since (25) iridium is rarely found on the Earth's surface, Alvarez reasoned that it had either come up from the Earth's core by volcanic action or been deposited by meteorite strikes from space. Because the iridium was deposited evenly in sediments worldwide, Alvarez found the (30) meteorite theory more likely.\n\nBut paleontologists-scientists who study dinosaurs-scoffed at the Alvarez extinction theory. Neither Luis nor Walter Alvarez was a paleontologist, yet they claimed to have solved a mystery that had (35) defied the efforts of paleontologists for over a century. Some scientists pointed out that, in order to create worldwide fallout of iridium on the scale suggested by Alvarez, the \"doomsday\" meteorite would have had to be about 5 miles in diameter, and its impact (40) would have formed a crater perhaps a hundred miles wide. If such a meteorite had hit the Earth, where was the crater?\n\nFinally, a decade after the cosmic extinction theory was first proposed, the crater was found. Lying on the (45) northern edge of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the crater is 110 miles wide. Long buried under sediment, it had actually been discovered in 1981 by oil geologists, but datings of nearby rock samples taken at that time suggested that it was significantly older than (50) 65 million years. New samples of melted rock from the crater itself were recently analyzed by an advanced dating process, however, and were found to be 64.98 million years old. Many scientists now feel that, thanks to the Alvarez theory, the mystery of dinosaur (55) extinction has finally been solved.",

        "passage": "The question of why dinosaurs became extinct has puzzled paleontologists since the first dinosaur fossil was found almost two centuries ago. These great reptiles dominated the Earth for almost 160 million (5) years, but mysteriously died out approximately 65 million years ago. Various explanations for this disappearance have been offered, ranging from an epidemic to a sudden, catastrophic drop in temperature. But no theory has yet been conclusively proven.\n\n(10) In 1980, Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, suggested a new explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs. According to Luis Alvarez and his geologist son Walter, a huge meteor crashed into the Earth's surface 65 million years ago, sending up a (15) massive cloud of dust and rock particles. The cloud blocked out sunlight for a period of months or even years, disrupting plant growth and the global food chain. The lack of plants as a food source, coupled with a significant drop in temperature, resulted in the (20) extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nAlvarez based his theory on an unusual piece of evidence. Geologists discovered that a thin layer of the metal iridium had been deposited all over the world at approximately the time the dinosaurs died out. Since (25) iridium is rarely found on the Earth's surface, Alvarez reasoned that it had either come up from the Earth's core by volcanic action or been deposited by meteorite strikes from space. Because the iridium was deposited evenly in sediments worldwide, Alvarez found the (30) meteorite theory more likely.\n\nBut paleontologists-scientists who study dinosaurs-scoffed at the Alvarez extinction theory. Neither Luis nor Walter Alvarez was a paleontologist, yet they claimed to have solved a mystery that had (35) defied the efforts of paleontologists for over a century. Some scientists pointed out that, in order to create worldwide fallout of iridium on the scale suggested by Alvarez, the \"doomsday\" meteorite would have had to be about 5 miles in diameter, and its impact (40) would have formed a crater perhaps a hundred miles wide. If such a meteorite had hit the Earth, where was the crater?\n\nFinally, a decade after the cosmic extinction theory was first proposed, the crater was found. Lying on the (45) northern edge of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the crater is 110 miles wide. Long buried under sediment, it had actually been discovered in 1981 by oil geologists, but datings of nearby rock samples taken at that time suggested that it was significantly older than (50) 65 million years.

        "passage": "Ehrich Weisz, better known as Harry Houdini, was born on March 24, 1874, in Budapest, Hungary. Upon his family's emigration to America when he was four years old, his parents legally changed their (5) last name to Weiss. Poorly educated, young Ehrich became inspired to perform magic when his father took him to see traveling illusionist Dr. Lynn. Surprisingly, Ehrich didn't have much success at first, and he experimented with a variety of magic tricks–(10) including card tricks, needle-swallowing, and escaping from handcuffs and boxes–before discovering the extreme escapes that would make him famous. Eventually, Ehrich took the name \"Houdini\" as an homage to legendary magician Jean Eugene (15) Robert-Houdin.\n\nOddly enough, Houdini's first encounter with a straitjacket was nothing special. He saw one for the first time on a trip to Nova Scotia in 1896. He became fascinated by it and added it to his act–but with a (20) twist. Instead of simply escaping from a straitjacket, Houdini escaped while suspended in midair by his ankles. In an article in the May 1918 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, Houdini revealed his great secret–during the escape, he dislocated both shoulders. Also, (25) escaping in midair had one major advantage: from so far away, audiences couldn't really see what he was doing. His midair escapes were so successful that Houdini later added a number of escapes from unusual locations, including water tanks, locked (30) crates, milk cans, and even a large paper bag–without making a single tear in it.\n\nHoudini was also fascinated by flight. In 1910, he purchased a biplane in Germany, then dismantled it and shipped it to Australia. He eventually became the (35) first person to fly a plane there. He also became interested in film; he starred in silent films called The Master Mystery and The Grim Game. In 1921, he founded a film company called the Houdini Picture Corporation and produced several movies. None of (40) his films were very successful.\n\nIn fact, none of Houdini's other ventures were as commercially successful as his magic-particularly his escapes. Throughout his life, Houdini pushed the envelope, improving on traditional escapes and (45) mastering completely new ones. According to legend, Houdini died during a performance of the Water Torture Cell illusion; in reality, he died in 1926 from a ruptured appendix after collapsing onstage in Detroit.

        "passage": "Ehrich Weisz, better known as Harry Houdini, was born on March 24, 1874, in Budapest, Hungary. Upon his family's emigration to America when he was four years old, his parents legally changed their (5) last name to Weiss. Poorly educated, young Ehrich became inspired to perform magic when his father took him to see traveling illusionist Dr. Lynn. Surprisingly, Ehrich didn't have much success at first, and he experimented with a variety of magic tricks–(10) including card tricks, needle-swallowing, and escaping from handcuffs and boxes–before discovering the extreme escapes that would make him famous. Eventually, Ehrich took the name \"Houdini\" as an homage to legendary magician Jean Eugene (15) Robert-Houdin.\n\nOddly enough, Houdini's first encounter with a straitjacket was nothing special. He saw one for the first time on a trip to Nova Scotia in 1896. He became fascinated by it and added it to his act–but with a (20) twist. Instead of simply escaping from a straitjacket, Houdini escaped while suspended in midair by his ankles. In an article in the May 1918 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, Houdini revealed his great secret–during the escape, he dislocated both shoulders. Also, (25) escaping in midair had one major advantage: from so far away, audiences couldn't really see what he was doing. His midair escapes were so successful that Houdini later added a number of escapes from unusual locations, including water tanks, locked (30) crates, milk cans, and even a large paper bag–without making a single tear in it.\n\nHoudini was also fascinated by flight. In 1910, he purchased a biplane in Germany, then dismantled it and shipped it to Australia. He eventually became the (35) first person to fly a plane there. He also became interested in film; he starred in silent films called The Master Mystery and The Grim Game. In 1921, he founded a film company called the Houdini Picture Corporation and produced several movies. None of (40) his films were very successful.\n\nIn fact, none of Houdini's other ventures were as commercially successful as his magic-particularly his escapes. Throughout his life, Houdini pushed the envelope, improving on traditional escapes and (45) mastering completely new ones. According to legend, Houdini died during a performance of the Water Torture Cell illusion; in reality, he died in 1926 from a ruptured appendix after collapsing onstage in Detroit. Despite being a skeptic about the afterlife, (50) Houdini always promised to communicate from the world of the dead if he could; his wife Bess held seances on October 31, the anniversary of his death, for years afterward.

        "passage": "In 1880, Ferdinand de Lesseps attempted to finance the construction of a canal in Panama. This canal would link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by cutting across the Isthmus of Panama, the shortest distance (5) between the two oceans. Ultimately, such a project would dramatically shorten many voyages. However, by 1888, de Lesseps had had enough. Some of the problems he faced were logistical in nature. For example, the volume of excavation that the canal (10) would require was beyond the capabilities of the era's technology. Likewise, all materials to be used on the canal had to be imported, and communities to house the canal's workers had to be constructed from scratch.\n\nThe (15) Isthmus of Panama also presented many environmental obstacles that had to be overcome before real progress could be made on the canal. The unique geology of the area resulted in frequent landslides, and tropical diseases plagued the workers. In fact, (20) during the six years that the canal was being constructed, between 10,000 and 20,000 workers died from various diseases, most notably malaria and yellow fever. As a result of these hardships, de Lesseps was forced to abandon his project, though his (25) company still retained the right to complete it.\n\nJust after the turn of the century, the United States began taking an active interest in the Panama Canal. The United States had been mulling over the idea of investing in a canal in Nicaragua, but experts managed (30) to convince American leaders that the Panama site was more suited for this type of project. However, de Lesseps's Compagnie Nouvelle refused to sell its contracts and equipment for less than $100 million. The Nicaraguan site was far less expensive. Finally, (35) afraid that the Americans would decide on the Nicaraguan canal, the Compagnie Nouvelle agreed to sell for only $40 million. Now, America had only to convince Panama and Colombia-since at this time, Panama was under Colombian rule-to sell them the (40) land. The Americans approached the Panamanians, who were eager to sell, but the Colombians refused. The Panamanians showed interest in staging a revolution, and the United States supported them by sending a battleship to Panama, which prevented any (45) Colombians from invading.\n\nAmerica's next step was to control the rampant diseases of the area. Colonel William Crawford Gorgas helped to rid the Isthmus of yellow fever and to limit the outbreaks of malaria. Though this was a (50) praiseworthy accomplishment, many of the obstacles that had faced de Lesseps remained. Landslides were still common, so a system of dredges was designed to remove debris from the locks that would be used to move ships across the canal. Once these problems (55) were solved, it still took a decade and the labor of more than 70,000 workers to construct the canal, all at a cost of nearly half a billion dollars.

        "passage": "In 1880, Ferdinand de Lesseps attempted to finance the construction of a canal in Panama. This canal would link the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by cutting across the Isthmus of Panama, the shortest distance (5) between the two oceans. Ultimately, such a project would dramatically shorten many voyages. However, by 1888, de Lesseps had had enough. Some of the problems he faced were logistical in nature. For example, the volume of excavation that the canal (10) would require was beyond the capabilities of the era's technology. Likewise, all materials to be used on the canal had to be imported, and communities to house the canal's workers had to be constructed from scratch.\n\nThe (15) Isthmus of Panama also presented many environmental obstacles that had to be overcome before real progress could be made on the canal. The unique geology of the area resulted in frequent landslides, and tropical diseases plagued the workers. In fact, (20) during the six years that the canal was being constructed, between 10,000 and 20,000 workers died from various diseases, most notably malaria and yellow fever. As a result of these hardships, de Lesseps was forced to abandon his project, though his (25) company still retained the right to complete it.\n\nJust after the turn of the century, the United States began taking an active interest in the Panama Canal. The United States had been mulling over the idea of investing in a canal in Nicaragua, but experts managed (30) to convince American leaders that the Panama site was more suited for this type of project. However, de Lesseps's Compagnie Nouvelle refused to sell its contracts and equipment for less than $100 million. The Nicaraguan site was far less expensive. Finally, (35) afraid that the Americans would decide on the Nicaraguan canal, the Compagnie Nouvelle agreed to sell for only $40 million. Now, America had only to convince Panama and Colombia-since at this time, Panama was under Colombian rule-to sell them the (40) land. The Americans approached the Panamanians, who were eager to sell, but the Colombians refused. The Panamanians showed interest in staging a revolution, and the United States supported them by sending a battleship to Panama, which prevented any (45) Colombians from invading.\n\nAmerica's next step was to control the rampant diseases of the area. Colonel William Crawford Gorgas helped to rid the Isthmus of yellow fever and to limit the outbreaks of malaria. Though this was a (50) praiseworthy accomplishment, many of the obstacles that had faced de Lesseps remained. Landslides were still common, so a system of dredges was designed to remove debris from the locks that would be used to move ships across the canal. Once these problems (55) were solved, it still took a decade and the labor of more than 70,000 workers to construct the canal, all at a cost of nearly half a billion dollars. The first ship passed through the canal on August 15, 1914, and throughout the twentieth century, nearly a million (60) vessels have crossed the Isthmus via the Panama Canal.",

        "passage": "This passage is from the short story\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was originally published in 1892. In this excerpt, renowned detective Sherlock Holmes and his companion and chronicler Dr. Watson have received an early morning visit from a distraught woman, afraid for her life. The stepdaughter of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, she has witnessed the mysterious death of her sister and been ill-treated by her stepfather, a violent and unpredictable man, who has unexpectedly burst in on Holmes and Watson.\n\nOur door had been suddenly dashed open, and a huge man had framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long (5) frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned (10) yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.\n\n(15) \"Which of you is Holmes?\" asked this apparition.\n\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\" said my companion quietly.\n\n\"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said Holmes blandly. \"Pray take a seat.\"\n\n(20) \"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have traced her. What has she been saying to you?\"\n\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year,\" said Holmes.\n\n\"What has she been saying to you?\" screamed the old (25) man furiously.\n\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\" continued my companion imperturbably.\n\n\"Ha! You put me off, do you?\" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop. \"I (30) know you, you scoundrel! I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\"\n\nMy friend smiled.\n\n\"Holmes, the busybody!\"\n\nHis smile broadened.\n\n(35) \"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\"\n\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \"Your conversation is most entertaining,\" said he. \"When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught.\"\n\n\"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to (40) meddle with my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\" He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n\n(45) \"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n\n\"He seems a very amiable person,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"I am not quite so bulky, but if he had (50) remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\" As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.",
