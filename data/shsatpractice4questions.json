The Archduke's driver drove so quickly the (30) rest of the way that none of the terrorists were able to attack his car. Ferdinand then attended the official reception at City Hall. Afterward, when he found out that the passengers in the second car had been badly injured, the Archduke insisted on (35) visiting the hospital where they were being cared for. When one of his staff argued that this might be dangerous, he was quickly overruled. On the way to the hospital, the driver took a wrong turn. Realizing his mistake, he stopped and began reversing. Just (40) then, one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, happened to be walking down the same road. The car moved slowly in reverse and came within five feet of the waiting Princip, who fired several times into the car, killing the Archduke. This was (45) the spark needed to inflame the tense situation in Europe. Within months, the entire continent would be engulfed in war.",
