        "passage": "It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n\nHow can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\n\nThe different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness. But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her, but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel. I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I had so miserably given life.",

For centuries, the Church and monarchies\nacross Europe had essentially partnered to provide\nsupplies, infrastructure, spiritual support, and\n(10) law and order to subjects in the cities and farm\ntowns that dotted the continent at the time. Henry,\nhowever, upended this order and asserted that a\nmonarch should be the supreme leader of his or\nher country, with final say on all issues - including\n(15) religion.

He simply wanted\nabsolute power in his kingdom so he could treat\nhis wives any way he wanted. He originally split\n(25) from the Catholic Church because they would not\nannul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of\nAragon. That meant that if he left her for another\nwoman, any sons he had with his future wife\nwould not have legitimate claim to being the\n(30) king of England. Once the Pope made it clear he\nwouldn't dissolve Henry's marriage, Henry split\nfrom the Catholic Church and started the Church\nof England, which, unsurprisingly, granted him his\nannulment. His break from the Catholic Church\n(35) wasn't really about high-minded ideals after\nall; he simply wanted to remove the Church's\noversight in order to do whatever he wanted.\n\n(38) Women were disposable in Henry VIII's worldview\nbecause the goal of all European kings at the time\n(40) was to produce male heirs. Henry felt his first wife\nCatherine was incapable of producing a boy, so he\nwanted her out of the way. Of course, our modern\nunderstanding of genetics tells us that it is in fact\nthe male whose genetic material determines the\n(45) sex of a baby, which makes Henry even more of\na vain monster in hindsight.

For\nexample, the trees, fish, plants, and animals that are\n(5) abundant in New England are extremely rare in the\nAmerican Southwest. That's because, in each region,\nclimate and geography create certain conditions\nthat make it easy for some species to thrive while\nothers can barely survive. These distinct climatic\n(10) and geographic are known as biomes.\n\n(11) Researchers, biologists, and ecologists around the\nworld identify different numbers of biomes, but\njust about everybody agrees on these six: desert,\ngrassland, rain forest, deciduous forest, taiga, and\n(15) tundra. These distinctions represent different\nclimates, geographic features, specific flora and\nfauna, and unique challenges for those organisms\nthat make their home in that environment.\n\n(19) Desert is one of the most straightforward biomes\n(20) to understand. A desert is any place in which less\nthan 9.75 inches of liquid rain falls annually.\nDeserts generally see very high temperatures\nduring daylight hours but also experience violent\ntemperature swings after dark. Some deserts, like\n(25) the Gobi in Asia, see snowfall, which contradicts\nmany people's preconceptions about deserts.\nDesert life is very challenging and requires plants\nand animals to make specific adaptations to find\nadequate food, water, and shelter to survive.\n\n(30) The second major biome is grassland, which, as its\nname implies, constitutes areas in which the most\ncommon plants are grasses. Rainfall in grasslands\nis sporadic, which is why plants and trees bigger\nthan grass cannot reliably grow there. Grasslands\n(35) are generally populated by small, herbivorous\nanimals and larger hunting carnivores that prey\nupon them.\n\n(38) Next is the rainforest, which, as its name implies,\nis a biome that includes areas with large, dense\n(40) foliage and a large amount of rainfall. In stark\ncontrast to deserts and grasslands, rainforests get\nmore than six feet of rain per year. This bounty\nof water means that trees can grow much taller\nand faster than they can in other biomes. The\n(45) availability of water, food, and shelter created\nby these conditions means that rainforests can\nsupport a great deal of plant and animal diversity.\n\n(48) Deciduous forests are similar to rainforests in that\nthey contain large trees, but deciduous forests face\n(50) much colder winters than their rainforest cousins.\nThat means that the trees in deciduous forests\noften lose their leaves after they change color in\nthe autumn and winter due to the cold conditions.\nPlants and animals in deciduous forests live very\n(55) seasonal Lives, which means they must develop\na wider range of abilities and strategies than\norganisms that live in more consistent climates.\n\n(58) The taiga biome represents another kind of\nforest that is less well-known (at least in the\n(60) United States) than rainforests or deciduous\nforests. Found primarily in the northern parts of\nEurope and Asia, taiga represents forests with\nexceptionally cold, harsh winters. Evergreen or fir\ntrees are the most common plants in the taiga\n(65) biome, which sees large-scale precipitation, both\nin the form of rain during warm months and snow\nduring cold months. Animals that live in the taiga\nbiome must ensure they stay warm during the\nwinter without becoming overheated during the\n(70) more temperate months.\n\n(71) Finally, the last basic biome is tundra. Tundra is\nextremely cold and barren land, generally found\naround the north and south poles. Growing\nseasons for plants in the tundra are exceptionally\n(75) short, which can leave this biome looking barren\nand blasted. Animals that choose to live in the\ntundra face daily struggle when it comes to\nfinding water to drink, food to eat, and warmth\nto stay alive.

These distinct climatic\n(10) and geographic are known as biomes.\n\n(11) Researchers, biologists, and ecologists around the\nworld identify different numbers of biomes, but\njust about everybody agrees on these six: desert,\ngrassland, rain forest, deciduous forest, taiga, and\n(15) tundra. These distinctions represent different\nclimates, geographic features, specific flora and\nfauna, and unique challenges for those organisms\nthat make their home in that environment.\n\n(19) Desert is one of the most straightforward biomes\n(20) to understand. A desert is any place in which less\nthan 9.75 inches of liquid rain falls annually.\nDeserts generally see very high temperatures\nduring daylight hours but also experience violent\ntemperature swings after dark. Some deserts, like\n(25) the Gobi in Asia, see snowfall, which contradicts\nmany people's preconceptions about deserts.\nDesert life is very challenging and requires plants\nand animals to make specific adaptations to find\nadequate food, water, and shelter to survive.\n\n(30) The second major biome is grassland, which, as its\nname implies, constitutes areas in which the most\ncommon plants are grasses. Rainfall in grasslands\nis sporadic, which is why plants and trees bigger\nthan grass cannot reliably grow there. Grasslands\n(35) are generally populated by small, herbivorous\nanimals and larger hunting carnivores that prey\nupon them.\n\n(38) Next is the rainforest, which, as its name implies,\nis a biome that includes areas with large, dense\n(40) foliage and a large amount of rainfall. In stark\ncontrast to deserts and grasslands, rainforests get\nmore than six feet of rain per year. This bounty\nof water means that trees can grow much taller\nand faster than they can in other biomes. The\n(45) availability of water, food, and shelter created\nby these conditions means that rainforests can\nsupport a great deal of plant and animal diversity.\n\n(48) Deciduous forests are similar to rainforests in that\nthey contain large trees, but deciduous forests face\n(50) much colder winters than their rainforest cousins.\nThat means that the trees in deciduous forests\noften lose their leaves after they change color in\nthe autumn and winter due to the cold conditions.\nPlants and animals in deciduous forests live very\n(55) seasonal Lives, which means they must develop\na wider range of abilities and strategies than\norganisms that live in more consistent climates.\n\n(58) The taiga biome represents another kind of\nforest that is less well-known (at least in the\n(60) United States) than rainforests or deciduous\nforests. Found primarily in the northern parts of\nEurope and Asia, taiga represents forests with\nexceptionally cold, harsh winters. Evergreen or fir\ntrees are the most common plants in the taiga\n(65) biome, which sees large-scale precipitation, both\nin the form of rain during warm months and snow\nduring cold months. Animals that live in the taiga\nbiome must ensure they stay warm during the\nwinter without becoming overheated during the\n(70) more temperate months.\n\n(71) Finally, the last basic biome is tundra. Tundra is\nextremely cold and barren land, generally found\naround the north and south poles. Growing\nseasons for plants in the tundra are exceptionally\n(75) short, which can leave this biome looking barren\nand blasted.

        "passage": "(1) If you've travelled even a little bit, you've probably\nobserved that different plants and animals\nare native to different parts of the country. For\nexample, the trees, fish, plants, and animals that are\n(5) abundant in New England are extremely rare in the\nAmerican Southwest. That's because, in each region,\nclimate and geography create certain conditions\nthat make it easy for some species to thrive while\nothers can barely survive. These distinct climatic\n(10) and geographic are known as biomes.\n\n(11) Researchers, biologists, and ecologists around the\nworld identify different numbers of biomes, but\njust about everybody agrees on these six: desert,\ngrassland, rain forest, deciduous forest, taiga, and\n(15) tundra. These distinctions represent different\nclimates, geographic features, specific flora and\nfauna, and unique challenges for those organisms\nthat make their home in that environment.\n\n(19) Desert is one of the most straightforward biomes\n(20) to understand. A desert is any place in which less\nthan 9.75 inches of liquid rain falls annually.\nDeserts generally see very high temperatures\nduring daylight hours but also experience violent\ntemperature swings after dark. Some deserts, like\n(25) the Gobi in Asia, see snowfall, which contradicts\nmany people's preconceptions about deserts.\nDesert life is very challenging and requires plants\nand animals to make specific adaptations to find\nadequate food, water, and shelter to survive.\n\n(30) The second major biome is grassland, which, as its\nname implies, constitutes areas in which the most\ncommon plants are grasses. Rainfall in grasslands\nis sporadic, which is why plants and trees bigger\nthan grass cannot reliably grow there. Grasslands\n(35) are generally populated by small, herbivorous\nanimals and larger hunting carnivores that prey\nupon them.\n\n(38) Next is the rainforest, which, as its name implies,\nis a biome that includes areas with large, dense\n(40) foliage and a large amount of rainfall. In stark\ncontrast to deserts and grasslands, rainforests get\nmore than six feet of rain per year. This bounty\nof water means that trees can grow much taller\nand faster than they can in other biomes. The\n(45) availability of water, food, and shelter created\nby these conditions means that rainforests can\nsupport a great deal of plant and animal diversity.\n\n(48) Deciduous forests are similar to rainforests in that\nthey contain large trees, but deciduous forests face\n(50) much colder winters than their rainforest cousins.\nThat means that the trees in deciduous forests\noften lose their leaves after they change color in\nthe autumn and winter due to the cold conditions.\nPlants and animals in deciduous forests live very\n(55) seasonal Lives, which means they must develop\na wider range of abilities and strategies than\norganisms that live in more consistent climates.\n\n(58) The taiga biome represents another kind of\nforest that is less well-known (at least in the\n(60) United States) than rainforests or deciduous\nforests. Found primarily in the northern parts of\nEurope and Asia, taiga represents forests with\nexceptionally cold, harsh winters. Evergreen or fir\ntrees are the most common plants in the taiga\n(65) biome, which sees large-scale precipitation, both\nin the form of rain during warm months and snow\nduring cold months. Animals that live in the taiga\nbiome must ensure they stay warm during the\nwinter without becoming overheated during the\n(70) more temperate months.\n\n(71) Finally, the last basic biome is tundra. Tundra is\nextremely cold and barren land, generally found\naround the north and south poles. Growing\nseasons for plants in the tundra are exceptionally\n(75) short, which can leave this biome looking barren\nand blasted. Animals that choose to live in the\ntundra face daily struggle when it comes to\nfinding water to drink, food to eat, and warmth\nto stay alive. It is every bit as harsh, if not harsher,\nthan the desert.\n\n| Location | Annual Rainfall (inches) | Are there tall trees? | Do leaves change color? | Does it snow in the winter? | Are there major seasonal changes? |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| LOCATION A | 70 | Yes | No | No | No |\n| LOCATION B | 8.75 | No | No | Yes | No |\n| LOCATION C | 37 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| LOCATION D | 21 | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| LOCATION E | 11 | No | No | Yes | No |",
