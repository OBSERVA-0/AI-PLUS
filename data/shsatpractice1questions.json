    "passage": "Paragraph 1:\nThe question of why dinosaurs became extinct has puzzled paleontologists since the first dinosaur fossil was found almost two centuries ago. These great reptiles dominated the Earth for almost 160 million years, but mysteriously died out approximately 65 million years ago. Various explanations for this disappearance have been offered, ranging from an epidemic to a sudden, catastrophic drop in temperature. But no theory has yet been conclusively proven.\n\nParagraph 2:\nIn 1980, Luis Alvarez, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, suggested a new explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs. According to Luis Alvarez and his geologist son Walter, a huge meteor crashed into the Earth's surface 65 million years ago, sending up a massive cloud of dust and rock particles. The cloud blocked out sunlight for a period of months or even years, disrupting plant growth and the global food chain. The lack of plants as a food source, coupled with a significant drop in temperature, resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nParagraph 3:\nAlvarez based his theory on an unusual piece of evidence. Geologists discovered that a thin layer of the metal iridium had been deposited all over the world at approximately the time the dinosaurs died out. Since iridium is rarely found on the Earth's surface, Alvarez reasoned that it had either come up from the Earth's core by volcanic action or been deposited by meteorite strikes from space. Because the iridium was deposited evenly in sediments worldwide, Alvarez found the meteorite theory more likely.\n\nParagraph 4:\nBut paleontologists – scientists who study dinosaurs – scoffed at the Alvarez extinction theory. Neither Luis nor Walter Alvarez was a paleontologist, yet they claimed to have solved a mystery that had defied the efforts of paleontologists for over a century. Some scientists pointed out that, in order to create worldwide fallout of iridium on the scale suggested by Alvarez, the \"doomsday\" meteorite would have had to be about 5 miles in diameter, and its impact would have formed a crater perhaps a hundred miles wide. If such a meteorite had hit the Earth, where was the crater?\n\nParagraph 5:\nFinally, a decade after the cosmic extinction theory was first proposed, the crater was found. Lying on the northern edge of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the crater is 110 miles wide. Long buried under sediment, it had actually been discovered in 1981 by oil geologists, but datings of nearby rock samples taken at that time suggested that it was significantly older than 65 million years. New samples of melted rock from the crater itself were recently analyzed by an advanced dating process, however, and were found to be 64.98 million years old. Many scientists now feel that, thanks to the Alvarez theory, the mystery of dinosaur extinction has finally been solved.",
