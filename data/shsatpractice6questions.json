        "passage": "Crete was settled around the year 5000 B.C. by travelers from Greece who journeyed across sixty miles of open water to reach this island in the Mediterranean Sea. With a jagged spine of mountains cutting across the land, the settlers realized that the potential for farming was very limited. As a means of survival, the people of Crete focused their attention on their geographical assets: the waters surrounding the island, their strategic position in the Mediterranean, and the natural harbors of the gently sloping northern coasts. Thus, the Cretans were the first people to develop a modern commercial economy based mainly on seafaring and trade.\n\nUsing evidence from several sources, we can understand some of the details of Cretan life. Archaeological findings support the legend that the people of Crete were skillful builders. The island's forests provided timber for building ships. Their ships were sea-worthy and must have required careful design and expert construction. Their ships had high, sharply curved bows and sterns, and keels covered in bronze that stood out beyond the prow, a design which shows that the boats were intended for ramming into enemy ships. This naval tactic, developed in Crete, dominated sea warfare during this time.\n\nBy the time of the Minoan civilization (2700 to 1450 B.C., the Bronze Age), Crete had become an important center of civilization. The buildings were tall for their time (several stories high), and their architecture was known for massive columns, courtyards, and grand staircases. Sometime around 1700 B.C., many of the palaces were destroyed, perhaps as a result of an earthquake or war, but the Cretans rebuilt them. The ruins of many of these grand palaces have been discovered and restored.\n\nThe success of the Cretans in trading gave people leisure time which could be spent doing amusing things; bullfights are one example of a popular pastime. Art works show people dressed in colorful clothes, large decorated hats, and fancy jewelry. As the culture developed, Crete became known for its sculpture, pottery and fresco painting. The remains of villages suggest that the society was middle-class. The palace of the priest-kings, the Minos, was as much a commercial center as it was a palace, demonstrating the importance of trade in the Cretan culture. Because it is relatively poor in resources, however, Crete's history of reliance upon trade has continued, even to the modern day. Today, Crete the largest Greek island and fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea is a popular tourist destination, partly because so many remains from ancient Crete have been discovered. Knossos, the largest architectural site on Crete and likely the political and cultural center of Crete during the Bronze Age, is among the most visited sites on the island.",

With a jagged spine of mountains cutting across the land, the settlers realized that the potential for farming was very limited. As a means of survival, the people of Crete focused their attention on their geographical assets: the waters surrounding the island, their strategic position in the Mediterranean, and the natural harbors of the gently sloping northern coasts. Thus, the Cretans were the first people to develop a modern commercial economy based mainly on seafaring and trade.\n\nUsing evidence from several sources, we can understand some of the details of Cretan life. Archaeological findings support the legend that the people of Crete were skillful builders. The island's forests provided timber for building ships. Their ships were sea-worthy and must have required careful design and expert construction. Their ships had high, sharply curved bows and sterns, and keels covered in bronze that stood out beyond the prow, a design which shows that the boats were intended for ramming into enemy ships. This naval tactic, developed in Crete, dominated sea warfare during this time.\n\nBy the time of the Minoan civilization (2700 to 1450 B.C., the Bronze Age), Crete had become an important center of civilization. The buildings were tall for their time (several stories high), and their architecture was known for massive columns, courtyards, and grand staircases. Sometime around 1700 B.C., many of the palaces were destroyed, perhaps as a result of an earthquake or war, but the Cretans rebuilt them. The ruins of many of these grand palaces have been discovered and restored.\n\nThe success of the Cretans in trading gave people leisure time which could be spent doing amusing things; bullfights are one example of a popular pastime. Art works show people dressed in colorful clothes, large decorated hats, and fancy jewelry. As the culture developed, Crete became known for its sculpture, pottery and fresco painting. The remains of villages suggest that the society was middle-class. The palace of the priest-kings, the Minos, was as much a commercial center as it was a palace, demonstrating the importance of trade in the Cretan culture. Because it is relatively poor in resources, however, Crete's history of reliance upon trade has continued, even to the modern day.

The fog seemed to break away as though split by a wedge, and the bow of a steamboat emerged, trailing fog-wreaths on either side like seaweed on the snout of Leviathan. I could see the pilot-house and a white-bearded man leaning partly out of it, on his elbows. He was clad in a blue uniform, and I remember noting how trim and quiet he was. His quietness, under the circumstances, was terrible. He accepted Destiny, marched hand in hand with it, and coolly measured the stroke. As he leaned there, he ran a calm and speculative eye over us, as though to determine the precise point of the collision, and took no notice whatever when our pilot, white with rage, shouted, 'Now you've done it!'\n\nOn looking back, I realize that the remark was too obvious to make rejoinder necessary.\n\n'Grab hold of something and hang on,' the red-faced man said to me. All his bluster had gone, and he seemed to have caught the contagion of preternatural calm. 'And listen to the women scream,' he said grimly-almost bitterly, I thought, as though he had been through the experience before.\n\nThe vessels came together before I could follow his advice. We must have been struck squarely amidships, for I saw nothing, the strange steamboat having passed beyond my line of vision. The Martinez heeled over, sharply, and there was a crashing and rending of timber. I was thrown flat on the wet deck, and before I could scramble to my feet I heard the scream of the women. This it was, I am certain, the most indescribable of blood-curdling sounds, that threw me into a panic. I remembered the life-preservers stored in the cabin, but was met at the door and swept backward by a wild rush of men and women.\n\nWhat happened in the next few minutes I do not recollect, though I have a clear remembrance of pulling down life-preservers from the overhead racks, while the red-faced man fastened them about the bodies of an hysterical group of women. This memory is as distinct and sharp as that of any picture I have seen. It is a picture, and I can see it now, the jagged edges of the hole in the side of the cabin, through which the grey fog swirled and eddied; the empty upholstered seats, littered with all the evidences of sudden flight, such as packages, hand satchels, umbrellas, and wraps; the red-faced man, stumping gallantly around on his artificial legs and buckling life-preservers on all comers; and finally, the screaming bedlam of women. This it was, the screaming of the women, that most tried my nerves.\n\nI remember the scene impelled me to sudden laughter, and in the next instant I realized I was becoming hysterical myself; for these were women of my own kind, like my mother and sisters, with the fear of death upon them and unwilling to die. And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy. They wanted to live, they were helpless, like rats in a trap, and they screamed.\n\nI descended to the lower deck. The Martinez was sinking fast, for the water was very near. Numbers of the passengers were leaping overboard. Others, in the water, were clamouring to be taken aboard again. No one heeded them. A cry arose that we were sinking. I was seized by the consequent panic, and went over the side in a surge of bodies. How I went over I do not know, though I did know, and instantly, why those in the water were so desirous of getting back on the steamer. The water was cold-so cold that it was painful. The pang, as I plunged into it, was as quick and sharp as that of fire. It bit to the marrow. It was like the grip of death. I gasped with the anguish and shock of it, filling my lungs before the life-preserver popped me to the surface. The taste of the salt was strong in my mouth, and I was strangling with the acrid stuff in my throat and lungs.\n\nBut it was the cold that was most distressing. I felt that I could survive but a few minutes. People were struggling and floundering in the water about me. I could hear them crying out to one another. And I heard, also, the sound of oars. Evidently the strange steamboat had lowered its boats. As the time went by I marveled that I was still alive. I had no sensation whatever in my lower limbs, while a chilling numbness was wrapping about my heart and creeping into it.\n\nThe noises grew indistinct, though I heard a final and despairing chorus of screams in the distance, and knew that the Martinez had gone down.

        "passage": "Kangaroos are fascinating creatures because they are so different from our usual idea of a mammal. Unlike most mammals, kangaroos rear their young in a pouch, and hop to get around. Their long, powerful hind legs are used for jumping, and their thick tail gives them balance. Their forelimbs are used almost like human hands. Despite these well-known characteristics, prevalant among all species of kangaroos, there are many lesser-known variations; species vary tremendously in such distinguishing characteristics as habitat, color, social patterns and size (they range in length from nine inches to more than eight feet).\n\nKangaroos are marsupials, a type of mammal characterized by the pouch in which females carry their young. It is believed that marsupials evolved separately from so-called placental mammals, such as humans. The earliest known marsupial lived in China about 125 million years ago. While some marsupials of that time remained in Asia, inany traveled across great distances. In most continents, marsupials were not able to compete successfully with placental mammals, so many marsupials became extinct. The opossum, found in the Americas, is a notable exception. In Australia, on the other hand, marsupials thrived, none more so than the kangaroo. Indeed, there are more than 60 species of kangaroo, ranging in size from many small species to the red kangaroo, the largest of the species. One reason kangaroos were able to evolve and survive is that they had few predators in Australia. The kangaroo is such a unique evolutionary success that it is the national emblem of Australia.\n\nSome people consider marsupials, including the kangaroo, to be a primitive form of mammal, and they point to the opossum in support of their claim. Their view is reflected in the statements they make about the Virginia opossum, the only marsupial native to North America. There is some evidence for such statements: fossils of marsupials that existed at the same time as dinosaurs, some 100 million years ago, have been classified as belonging to the same group as the Virginia opossum.\n\nBut even if the opossum can in some ways be considered a 'living fossil,' the same cannot be said about the kangaroo. These Australian marsupials of the Macropodidae ('big feet') family have changed recently in order to adapt to a changing environment. This is a very common occurrence in the evolutionary patterns of all animals. In fact, almost every family of animals, from fish to insects to mammals, has changed in some way since its ancient ancestors roamed the earth. Even plants and trees, seemingly the same as they were eons ago, exhibit characteristics that are relatively new. In the case of Macropodidae, they evolved from small forest animals into ones that live mainly in open spaces.

The memorial, the first dedicated to the civil rights movement, consists of two distinct pieces of black Canadian granite. One piece carries this quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.: '...until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.' The other piece is a circular slab, placed low enough to be touched by visiting children. On this slab is a time line chronicling the major events of the movement, from the Supreme Court's Brown vs. the Board of Education ruling in 1954 to assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968. Other events noted on the memorial include the Montgomery Alabama Bus Boycott, the March on Washington (the 'I Have a Dream' speech), and the signing of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe names of 40 men, women, and children killed during the civil rights movement also appear on the circular slab. Three types of martyrs are commemorated: those who were killed during acts of non-violent protest, those whose deaths were embraced by civil rights leaders to help create momentum for further change, and those who were murdered by anti-movement agitators in order to intimidate other civil rights activists. The intention of those who built the memorial was to represent how each martyr added to the momentum of the struggle, and therefore did not die in vain.\n\nThe memorial was designed by Maya Lin, a Chinese-American woman from Ohio. At the age of 21, while a student at Yale, Lin won a competition to design the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. Eight years later, Lin was asked to design the Civil Rights Memorial. In creating her design for the memorial, Lin was inspired by King's 'mighty stream' quote. The form of the monument and the time-line concept took shape: water flows from a fountain over the names of the 40 martyrs.\n\nThe monument was commissioned by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The center was founded in the sixties by two lawyers and provided legal defense for the men and women of the civil rights movement. Today, the center is a not-for-profit organization. The main function of the center is to remind the world of what has passed and educate our future leaders. The memorial is a symbol of these goals.\n\nThe Memorial is located on an open plaza near two historically important buildings: the capitol steps where the 1965 voting rights march ended, and the church at which King was pastor during the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955-1956. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, 'The plaza is a contemplative area a place to remember the Movement, to honor those killed during the struggle, to appreciate how far the country has come in its quest for equality and consider how far it has to go.'

    "passage": "(1) John Philip Sousa was no Beethoven.\nNevertheless, he made a contribu-\n(5) tion to music. When you say \"a Sousa\nmarch,\" almost everyone will know\nwhat you are talking about. All of his\nmarches bear the stamp of a vigorous,\n(10) clear-cut, original musical personality.\nAbove all they are intensely practical.\n\n(15) Sousa began studying traditional music\ntheory when he was six. As a teenager,\nit looked as if he would follow in the\nfootsteps of his father, a trombonist. In\n(20) 1880, as a member of the U.S. Marine\nCorps, he became the bandmaster of\nthe Marine Band, where he gradually\nbecame known as a bandmaster of\n(25) incredible precision. The marches he\nwrote, first for the Marine Band and\nlater for his own band, were intended to\nset the pace for marching men.\n\n(30) A march is a piece of music with a\nstrong rhythm, usually written for the\nexpress purpose of playing while people\n(often military personnel) march.
