In the winter,\nwhen the maples and oaks stand like toothpicks and snow coats the western Pennsylvania\nvalley, Werner gazes out his kitchen window and caresses his prizewinning seeds. The\n*(5)* topsoil is frozen solid, and his orange tractor sits unused in the garage. He is not a big\ntalker, but every Thursday his buddy Dave Stelts phones him, and their conversation\nalways comes back to springtime—to the pumpkin patch and the weigh-off.\n\nIn April, Werner germinates his seeds, each one as long as a quarter, by soaking them\nin a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water. He pots them and incubates them in a cooler\n*(10)* with heating pads. He then places the seedlings under fluorescent lights upstairs in what he calls his\npumpkin room. On nice days, he takes the little pots outside for an hour or two for fresh\nair and natural sunlight. In May, every seedling is planted in the patch under its own clear\nplastic tent fitted with incandescent bulbs that are switched on during chilly nights.\n*(15)* Within weeks, the vines stretch out from underneath the plastic like octopus arms.

Werner straddled the orange mesh fence that\nsurrounds his garden and waded through a sea of stiff, broad leaves toward a thigh-high\ndome covered by an old bedsheet.

Werner whipped off the sheet,\n*(25)* and there sat a shiny pale pumpkin (they turn orange later in the year) that seemed to sag\non one side like a mound of Silly Putty left out in the sun.

Even if the crack wasn’t\nenough to disqualify the fruit from competition (and it was), it could widen and let in\nbacteria that would quickly rot the pumpkin from the inside. “That makes me sick,” he\nsaid. “This is the reason why I grow so many.”\n\n*(35)* Werner and his pal Dave Stelts are competitive gardeners who vie for bragging rights\nand prize money ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars.

In general he has kept about two-thirds of his colossal gourds intact. In 2008, he\nearned the title of “grower of the year” after trucking pumpkins to six weigh-offs and\nwinning five. His pumpkins had an average weight of nearly 1,500 pounds (680 kg). “I lost\nby two pounds in the sixth,” he says.\n\n*(45)* Since the 1980s, giant pumpkins have tripled in size, thanks to strategic breeding and\nhardcore growers with time on their hands and dirt under their fingernails.

          "passage": "The Great Pumpkin\nby Brendan Borrell\nThe Patch\n\nQuinn Werner’s backyard pumpkin patch overlooks a wooded creek. In the winter,\nwhen the maples and oaks stand like toothpicks and snow coats the western Pennsylvania\nvalley, Werner gazes out his kitchen window and caresses his prizewinning seeds. The\n*(5)* topsoil is frozen solid, and his orange tractor sits unused in the garage. He is not a big\ntalker, but every Thursday his buddy Dave Stelts phones him, and their conversation\nalways comes back to springtime—to the pumpkin patch and the weigh-off.\n\nIn April, Werner germinates his seeds, each one as long as a quarter, by soaking them\nin a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water. He pots them and incubates them in a cooler\n*(10)* with heating pads. He then places the seedlings under fluorescent lights upstairs in what he calls his\npumpkin room. On nice days, he takes the little pots outside for an hour or two for fresh\nair and natural sunlight. In May, every seedling is planted in the patch under its own clear\nplastic tent fitted with incandescent bulbs that are switched on during chilly nights.\n*(15)* Within weeks, the vines stretch out from underneath the plastic like octopus arms. In\nJune, when the first golden trumpets of female flowers begin to open, Werner pollinates\nthem by brushing them with pollen-covered stamens from select male flowers. Then he\ncovers them with plastic cups to prevent honeybees from meddling.\n\nWhen I visited Werner’s property on a sweltering summer afternoon, he was checking\n*(20)* his patch for the third time that day. Werner straddled the orange mesh fence that\nsurrounds his garden and waded through a sea of stiff, broad leaves toward a thigh-high\ndome covered by an old bedsheet. His 12 pumpkins had been growing for less than a month, so I had expected that one\nwould be small enough to hoist into the back seat of a car. Werner whipped off the sheet,\n*(25)* and there sat a shiny pale pumpkin (they turn orange later in the year) that seemed to sag\non one side like a mound of Silly Putty left out in the sun. Based on its circumference, he\nguessed it was pushing 400 pounds (180 kilograms). And the season had just begun.\nWerner beamed. “It’s real long and real wide,” he said. “It’s in really good shape.”\nBut as he leaned in closer, running his hand along a smooth ridge, his face grew taut.\n*(30)* “Oh, man, as a matter of fact, it’s split.”\nTucked into the blossom end of the pumpkin was a tiny crack. Even if the crack wasn’t\nenough to disqualify the fruit from competition (and it was), it could widen and let in\nbacteria that would quickly rot the pumpkin from the inside. “That makes me sick,” he\nsaid. “This is the reason why I grow so many.”\n\n*(35)* Werner and his pal Dave Stelts are competitive gardeners who vie for bragging rights\nand prize money ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. Their crop of\nchoice is the Atlantic Giant Pumpkin, a freak of nature and intensive breeding. During\npeak growing season, these pumpkins can gain 50 pounds (23 kg) per day—which is\nsometimes too much. The cracked pumpkin Werner showed me had swollen too quickly\n*(40)* after a hard rain. In general he has kept about two-thirds of his colossal gourds intact. In 2008, he\nearned the title of “grower of the year” after trucking pumpkins to six weigh-offs and\nwinning five. His pumpkins had an average weight of nearly 1,500 pounds (680 kg). “I lost\nby two pounds in the sixth,” he says.\n\n*(45)* Since the 1980s, giant pumpkins have tripled in size, thanks to strategic breeding and\nhardcore growers with time on their hands and dirt under their fingernails. (From April to\nOctober, Werner spends six to eight hours per day tending his garden.) Thomas Andres, a\nsquash expert who works at the New York Botanical Garden, has predicted that the first\npumpkin weighing one ton (2,000 pounds, or 900 kg) will appear in 2014.\n\n*(50)* The Ohio Valley contest, Werner’s local weigh-off, is one of the more than 80\ncompetitions in the “Great Pumpkin Belt,” an area that stretches across North America\nfrom Washington State to Nova Scotia. This is prime pumpkin territory. The region has\n90 to 120 frost-free summer days, but is cold enough in winter to keep plant diseases and\npests in check. The weigh-offs are\n*(55)* friendly competitions, but they’re also\na form of at-home science. Growers\nmeticulously graph their pumpkins’\ngrowth curves and share successes\nand failures—and seeds—with their\npeers.\n\n*(60)* “By God, if we can get a\npumpkin up to a ton, imagine what\nwe can do with somebody’s vegetable\ncrop,” says Stelts, president of the\nGreat Pumpkin Commonwealth.\n*(65)* “What we are doing will be reflected\non the dinner table of America.”",

  "passage": "Allegra Shapiro is twelve years old and lives in Portland, Oregon. She is waiting for her turn\nto compete in the Bloch Competition where she will be playing music by Wolfgang Amadeus\nMozart (1756-1791), a famous classical composer. In order to play well and to focus both\nbefore and during her performance, Allegra pictures images in her mind. Often she imagines\nher beloved great-grandmother, Elter Bubbe Leah.\n\nExcerpt from The Mozart Season\nby Virginia Euwer Wolff\n\nAs I looked at the keyboard of the piano, my mind tried to empty itself; it tried to\n*(5)* pour all my thoughts down a chute of some kind. I could feel them sliding away. Like a\nbig balloon deflating, like a tank of something emptying. I felt my eyes bug out with the\nshock of it, and I saw my arms reach out to catch what was emptying out of me. I stood\nthere looking at the space between my arms, and tried to find Mozart. I closed my eyes\nand looked for the first movement first; there it was, with its cadenza.¹ Second movement.\n*(10)* Third. They were there, with their notes in order, with Mr. Kaplan’s blue markings on\nthe pages.\nVery strange, my mind doing that. I picked up my violin and played the third-\nmovement cadenza. It was there, solid, it hadn’t gone off anywhere. I wrapped Elter Bubbe\nLeah’s purse in its tissue paper and put it back in my violin case. I went down the hallway\n*(15)* to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror. I was just a person in a blue dress\nstanding in dim light in a public bathroom next to a towel machine. I turned around and\nwent back to room 104 and sat down with my violin and bow in my hand.\nThe envelope woman came and got me, and we walked down the hall and then down\nthe stairs and then through a heavy door. Suddenly the lights were very bright and the\n*(20)* floor was very polished and there was a line of screens on my right. Several screens were\nlined up so the jury couldn’t see any part of me, even my feet. The woman pointed to\nwhere I was supposed to stand. I went to the spot and stood. It was the place Steve\nLandauer, Number Three, had just walked away from. I suddenly remembered Alice in\nWonderland getting smaller and smaller. I propped myself firmly on my feet, looked\n*(25)* down at them; they were the same size they’d been five minutes before, and I knew I\nwasn’t shrinking.\nI decided to look at the vertical line down one of the screens.\nA man’s voice came from the other side of the screens: “Number Four, you may begin\nwhen you’re ready.”\n*(30)* I thumbed my strings and heard the D string a shade flat. While I was tuning it I\nclosed my eyes and saw Elter Bubbe Leah’s photograph with the purse and the goose and\nthe broom, and into my vision came a teenage hand with a quill pen in it, just at the edge\nof the photograph. Music being written. I listened in my mind for the rhythm and I took a\nmedium-size breath and started.\n*(35)* The start was a good one; notes came up out of the violin on time, in time, things\nweren’t blurred, it was fun. Through the notes, I saw Elter Bubbe Leah shooing her geese\nup a slope with her broom in Poland; the notes went scooting along. It was strange: I was\nable to hear every note clearly, every group of sixteenth-notes, every little sforzando,² and\nat the same time I was seeing a movie of pastures and the little house in Suprasl.\n*(40)* The second movement. How many times Heavenly and I’d gone to sleep listening to it,\nwith our arms around each other. I reached inside my body for the key change and the\nrhythm change and I felt for the gentleness of it. I saw Leah, a little girl in a long white\nnightgown, climbing into her bed by candlelight, and I took a medium-size breath and\nplayed. The notes sounded like little flickerings of flame from the candle, little bright\n*(45)* lights floating in a dark room. I played it for her to drop off to sleep in her feather bed\nwith her braids spread out on the pillow.\nThe third movement, the Rondeau.³ If you turn on the radio just in time to hear this\nmovement, you think it’s such a happy thing, those alternating sections, dances. And yet,\nwhen you pay close attention, there’s a kind of fragile sound—as if something’s going to\n*(50)* break somewhere but you don’t know where. And little silences come up between the\nsections. I looked into what was going on in my mind and I saw the early morning waking\nLeah up with the sun coming in, a blessing. I took a medium-size breath and began. She\nwoke up in the sunshine and she was a real girl in a real house, and I could see the grass\nand flowers growing as she walked outside, and I could feel the solid ground under her\n*(55)* feet, and during the cadenza she was scampering along, very happy. And I got so carried\naway with the little girl in the story in my mind that I played an E-sharp a little bit askew,\nmy finger came down on it too sideways. But I was happy. I was happy with the sounds of\nMozart coming up out of the wood, and as I moved toward the ending it felt right.

I played it for her to drop off to sleep in her feather bed\nwith her braids spread out on the pillow.\nThe third movement, the Rondeau.³ If you turn on the radio just in time to hear this\nmovement, you think it’s such a happy thing, those alternating sections, dances. And yet,\nwhen you pay close attention, there’s a kind of fragile sound—as if something’s going to\n*(50)* break somewhere but you don’t know where. And little silences come up between the\nsections. I looked into what was going on in my mind and I saw the early morning waking\nLeah up with the sun coming in, a blessing. I took a medium-size breath and began. She\nwoke up in the sunshine and she was a real girl in a real house, and I could see the grass\nand flowers growing as she walked outside, and I could feel the solid ground under her\n*(55)* feet, and during the cadenza she was scampering along, very happy. And I got so carried\naway with the little girl in the story in my mind that I played an E-sharp a little bit askew,\nmy finger came down on it too sideways. But I was happy. I was happy with the sounds of\nMozart coming up out of the wood, and as I moved toward the ending it felt right. The\nlast three notes came out just the way I liked them, balanced, even, each one of them\n*(60)* getting softer until the last one just skips away into the air.\nI took my violin down off my shoulder. I was in Portland, Oregon, and I’d just\nfinished doing what I’d promised and feared to do. I was twelve years old, standing with\nmy two feet on the floor and my arms hanging down. I might never even tell anybody\nabout Leah and her goose and her feather bed in my mind. A whole story of her had\n*(65)* happened inside the music. I looked down at the scroll⁴ of my violin. It’s like a seashell, as\nif there’s such a story inside that you could never find out all of it.\nA man’s voice came from the other side of the screen. “Thank you, Number Four.”\n\n¹ cadenza: a solo inserted into a movement (or section of music), typically near the end\n² sforzando: a strong, sudden accent on a note or chord\n³ Rondeau: a medieval French song\n⁴ scroll: the wooden handle of a violin appears rolled up like a paper scroll",

  "passage": "Telling Plastic to 'Bag It'\nby Patricia Smith\nwith reporting by William Yardley of The New York Times\n\nTwo years ago, a dead gray whale washed ashore in Seattle’s Puget Sound. When\nscientists examined the contents of the whale’s stomach, they found more than 20 plastic\nbags. “It was a gut-wrenching experience for me,” says Robb Krehbiel, 23, of Seattle,\n*(5)* “Nothing that we use for a few minutes should ever end up in the belly of a whale. That’s\njust so wrong.”\nFor the last seven months, Krehbiel has been working on a campaign to ban plastic\ngrocery bags in Seattle. The ban passed in December and will go into effect July 1.\nSeattle will join cities like San Francisco; San Jose, California; Portland, Oregon;\n*(10)* Brownsville, Texas; and Westport, Connecticut, as well as the Outer Banks of North\nCarolina and several counties in Hawaii, that have already banned plastic grocery bags.\nAnd Washington, D.C., has begun charging a five-cent tax on plastic bags to discourage\ncustomers from using them.\nSince 2009, 12 states have considered a variety of plastic-bag bans, according to The\n*(15)* National Conference of State Legislatures. No statewide bans have passed. But the list of\ncities and counties with bag bans is growing.\nAmericans use between 70 billion and 100 billion plastic bags annually, with families\ntaking home an average of 1,500 a year.\n\nPaper Vs. Plastic\n\n*(20)* Environmental groups say plastic bags, which are made from petroleum products,\nincrease America’s dependence on oil and are a chief cause of litter. It takes about\n12 million barrels of oil to make the plastic bags used in the U.S. annually. Most plastic\nbags eventually end up in landfills, where it can take hundreds of years for them to\ndecompose. But first, or instead, many become litter.\n*(25)* “They’re hanging from trees and littering our beaches,” says Eric Goldstein of the\nNational Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.\nPlastic bags are also a major source of pollution in the ocean, where they can harm sea\nturtles and other ocean creatures that mistake the bags for food and eat them.\nBut Mark Daniels of Hilex Poly, a plastics maker based in South Carolina, calls the\n*(30)* bans “badly misguided efforts.” He says 90 percent of Americans already reuse plastic grocery bags—as garbage bags,\nto pack school lunches, and to store household items.\n“Moving consumers away from plastic bags only pushes people to less environmentally\nfriendly options, such as paper bags, which require more energy to produce and transport,\n*(35)* and reusable bags, which are not recyclable,” Daniels says.\nThe plastic-bag manufacturing industry employs 10,000 Americans, and bans\njeopardize those jobs, the industry says.\nThe U.S. is not the only place where bans have been instituted. Plastic bags are now\nbanned in several nations including China, Italy, France, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Rwanda.\n*(40)* Other countries tax plastic bags to discourage their use. In Ireland, for example, a\n15-cent-per-bag tax introduced in 2002 has reduced their use by more than 90 percent.\n\nPlastic Bottle Bans\n\nEnvironmentalists in recent years have also targeted disposable plastic bottles for many\nof the same reasons they’ve set their sights on bags. The town of Concord, Massachusetts;\n*(45)* several national parks, including the Grand Canyon; and a growing list of universities now\nban the sale of disposable water bottles. A handful of big cities, like San Francisco and\nSeattle, ban the sale of plastic water bottles in government offices.\nThe plastic-bag bans already in effect have had a dramatic effect on litter, some\nofficials say. In Brownsville, Texas, a plastic-bag ban in place for more than a year has\n*(50)* eliminated more than 350,000 bags per day, according to former Mayor Pat Ahumada. He\nsays the ban “transformed our city from littered and dirty to a much cleaner city.”\nUnder the Seattle ban, plastic bags will still be available for produce and bulk grocery\nitems. The new law also imposes a five-cent fee on paper bags.\nThree years ago, Seattle city officials approved a 20-cent-per-bag fee on paper and\n*(55)* plastic bags. The idea was to create a financial incentive to reduce pollution; the fee was\nsupposed to prompt people to bring reusable bags with them to shop.\nBut before the 2008 fee could take effect, the plastic-bag industry led a petition drive\nthat forced the issue onto a citywide ballot. In August 2009, in the midst of the recession\nand after the industry spent $1.4 million on the campaign, Seattle voters rejected the fee.\n*(60)* It’s not yet clear if the plastic bag industry will mount a similar campaign this time.\nIf there’s a fight, Krehbiel, the Seattle activist, will be one of those arguing to keep the\nban. “It’s not going to be a silver bullet that solves all our environmental problems,” he says.\n“But my thinking is you do what you can, when you can, where you can.”\n\nPlastic Bags: By the Numbers\n1,500: Average number of plastic shopping bags American families take home annually.

The ban passed in December and will go into effect July 1.\nSeattle will join cities like San Francisco; San Jose, California; Portland, Oregon;\n*(10)* Brownsville, Texas; and Westport, Connecticut, as well as the Outer Banks of North\nCarolina and several counties in Hawaii, that have already banned plastic grocery bags.\nAnd Washington, D.C., has begun charging a five-cent tax on plastic bags to discourage\ncustomers from using them.\nSince 2009, 12 states have considered a variety of plastic-bag bans, according to The\n*(15)* National Conference of State Legislatures. No statewide bans have passed. But the list of\ncities and counties with bag bans is growing.\nAmericans use between 70 billion and 100 billion plastic bags annually, with families\ntaking home an average of 1,500 a year.\n\nPaper Vs. Plastic\n\n*(20)* Environmental groups say plastic bags, which are made from petroleum products,\nincrease America’s dependence on oil and are a chief cause of litter. It takes about\n12 million barrels of oil to make the plastic bags used in the U.S. annually. Most plastic\nbags eventually end up in landfills, where it can take hundreds of years for them to\ndecompose. But first, or instead, many become litter.\n*(25)* “They’re hanging from trees and littering our beaches,” says Eric Goldstein of the\nNational Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.\nPlastic bags are also a major source of pollution in the ocean, where they can harm sea\nturtles and other ocean creatures that mistake the bags for food and eat them.\nBut Mark Daniels of Hilex Poly, a plastics maker based in South Carolina, calls the\n*(30)* bans “badly misguided efforts.” He says 90 percent of Americans already reuse plastic grocery bags—as garbage bags,\nto pack school lunches, and to store household items.\n“Moving consumers away from plastic bags only pushes people to less environmentally\nfriendly options, such as paper bags, which require more energy to produce and transport,\n*(35)* and reusable bags, which are not recyclable,” Daniels says.\nThe plastic-bag manufacturing industry employs 10,000 Americans, and bans\njeopardize those jobs, the industry says.\nThe U.S. is not the only place where bans have been instituted. Plastic bags are now\nbanned in several nations including China, Italy, France, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Rwanda.\n*(40)* Other countries tax plastic bags to discourage their use. In Ireland, for example, a\n15-cent-per-bag tax introduced in 2002 has reduced their use by more than 90 percent.\n\nPlastic Bottle Bans\n\nEnvironmentalists in recent years have also targeted disposable plastic bottles for many\nof the same reasons they’ve set their sights on bags. The town of Concord, Massachusetts;\n*(45)* several national parks, including the Grand Canyon; and a growing list of universities now\nban the sale of disposable water bottles. A handful of big cities, like San Francisco and\nSeattle, ban the sale of plastic water bottles in government offices.\nThe plastic-bag bans already in effect have had a dramatic effect on litter, some\nofficials say. In Brownsville, Texas, a plastic-bag ban in place for more than a year has\n*(50)* eliminated more than 350,000 bags per day, according to former Mayor Pat Ahumada. He\nsays the ban “transformed our city from littered and dirty to a much cleaner city.”\nUnder the Seattle ban, plastic bags will still be available for produce and bulk grocery\nitems. The new law also imposes a five-cent fee on paper bags.\nThree years ago, Seattle city officials approved a 20-cent-per-bag fee on paper and\n*(55)* plastic bags. The idea was to create a financial incentive to reduce pollution; the fee was\nsupposed to prompt people to bring reusable bags with them to shop.\nBut before the 2008 fee could take effect, the plastic-bag industry led a petition drive\nthat forced the issue onto a citywide ballot. In August 2009, in the midst of the recession\nand after the industry spent $1.4 million on the campaign, Seattle voters rejected the fee.\n*(60)* It’s not yet clear if the plastic bag industry will mount a similar campaign this time.\nIf there’s a fight, Krehbiel, the Seattle activist, will be one of those arguing to keep the\nban. “It’s not going to be a silver bullet that solves all our environmental problems,” he says.\n“But my thinking is you do what you can, when you can, where you can.”\n\nPlastic Bags: By the Numbers\n1,500: Average number of plastic shopping bags American families take home annually.

There, in states such as Illinois and Iowa, they found just what they were\n*(5)* looking for: prairies full of rich, black dirt that promised to pump life into seeds as fast as\nthey were planted.\nUnfortunately, many settlers soon felt like thirsty sailors in the middle of the ocean—\nwater everywhere but not a drop to drink. Rich soil surrounded them, but their equipment\ncould not plow it. That was the problem a blacksmith named John Deere faced when he\n*(10)* arrived in Grand Detour, Illinois, in 1836.\nHis Illinois neighbors had been desperate for a blacksmith ever since they had settled\nin Grand Detour. No sooner did Deere set foot in town than he found a line of farmers\neager to offer him business. Two days after his arrival in Grand Detour, he was hard at\nwork fixing broken equipment.\n*(15)* While working at his shop, Deere frequently heard complaints from farmers about the\nsoil. Their early excitement about the richness of the soil and the ease with which a plow\ncould break the sod had turned to frustration. The soil was too rich. Instead of falling\naway from the plow like sandy New England soil, it stuck. Farmers had to stop every few\nseconds to scrape the clumped dirt off their iron plowshares with large wooden paddles.\n*(20)* They might as well have been plowing through a rocky field for all the progress they were\nmaking. Some farmers were so discouraged by the sticky soil that they left in search of\nnew land; others were ready to join them.\nDeere decided to look into the problem. From his previous work on plows, he knew\nthat dirt was less likely to stick to highly polished metal. That thought was in the back of\n*(25)* his mind when he visited a sawmill in 1837 and noticed a broken circular saw made of\nsteel, a polished metal that was too expensive to be widely used for implements. Steel had\nnever been used to make a plowshare.¹\nDeere took the broken saw blade home with him and began working on a better plow.\nHe knew that polished steel was not the whole answer; the shape of the plow’s bottom was\n*(30)* also important. The plow Deere wanted to make would have to cut deeply into the soil at a sharp\nangle so that dirt would fall off, yet it could not put too much burden on the horses\npulling it. After some experiments, Deere found the curved shape he needed and pounded\nthe steel saw blade into that shape. He then built a plow, complete with oak handles, and\nbrought it to the farm of his neighbor, Lewis Crandall.\n*(35)* While an anxious crowd of Grand Detour farmers watched, Crandall tried the new\nplow. He pronounced it a success. Not only did dirt fall away cleanly from the blade, but\nthe plow also turned the soil more quickly than the old cast-iron plows.\nOther farmers wanted one of Deere’s “self-scouring” plows. The blacksmith could not\nmeet the instant demand, however. For one thing, polished steel was hard to find. Deere\n*(40)* could not count on a steady supply of broken saw blades to use as raw material. Steel was\nonly available from England, and it was expensive to import. There was no such thing as\nmass production in the blacksmithing business; plows were made one at a time according\nto each customer’s needs. Deere and his new partner in the business, Leonard Andrus,\nmanufactured only 2 “self-scouring” plows in 1838 and 10 the following year.\n*(45)* Production gradually increased, however, as Deere imported greater quantities of\nexpensive English steel. Forty handmade plows left his shop in 1840 and, after expanding\nhis workshop to include a foundry in 1843, Deere’s production rose to 400 plows a year.\nUntil then, Deere still considered himself a blacksmith—his plow was just one part of\nhis craft. But after seeing that he could easily sell as many plows as he could make, even\n*(50)* using costly English steel, the blacksmith decided to devote his time to manufacturing\nplows. In 1846 he found a Pittsburgh steel firm that could supply him with all the steel he\nneeded for a lower price than what the English steel cost. The following year, he moved\nhis business to Moline, Illinois, where the Mississippi River provided water power and\ntransportation.\n*(55)* During the early years, Deere’s sales strategy consisted of loading a wagon with plows\nand visiting farms until all his merchandise was sold. He rarely had to travel far.\nProducing plows before they were ordered was an innovative approach to sales. By 1857\nthe company, which he had reorganized with new partners under the name John Deere &\nCompany, was making and selling 10,000 plows a year—nearly seven times as many as he\n*(60)* had sold just seven years earlier.\nA relentless perfectionist, Deere kept tinkering with his plows, trying to make them\nbetter. He came out with 10 new versions of his plow in a single year. While this slowed\ndown his production ability, it ensured Deere a solid reputation among his customers.\nDeere plows became world famous in the 1870s when they outshone the competition in a\n*(65)* demonstration in France. That same decade, the company built its first riding plow and\ndesigned the leaping deer as its trademark.\n\n¹ Historians now believe that the first steel plowshare was made by John Lane in 1833.

  "passage": "Lewis Latimer\nby Stephen Currie\n\nThough electric light was slow to catch on among the public, it was evident to\nscientists and inventors across America that a new age was dawning. Electricity, they\nrealized, was the wave of the future.\n\n*(5)* One of the first Americans to recognize the potential of electricity was a black man\nnamed Lewis Latimer. Born in Massachusetts in 1848, Latimer served in the U.S. Navy\nduring the Civil War. When the war was over, Latimer returned to Massachusetts and got\na job with a law firm that specialized in patents and inventions. At first he worked as an\noffice boy, delivering messages and doing other simple tasks that involved little\n*(10)* responsibility. Assignments like these made some sense, given his youth and relative\ninexperience. It is also likely, however, that Latimer’s race kept him from being considered\nfor positions that carried more authority—and a larger paycheck.\nLatimer did not wish to remain an office assistant for long, though. He soon became\nintrigued by the work of the company’s draftsmen. To apply for a patent, inventors had to\n*(15)* provide careful pictures that showed every detail of their inventions. Because most\ninventors did not have the skill to execute these pictures on their own, patent lawyers\ntypically had expert draftsmen on staff to create the diagrams. Latimer resolved to learn\neverything he could about drafting. He studied drawing techniques at home and\npracticed them whenever he could. Before long, his bosses recognized his talent and\n*(20)* promoted him to the post of draftsman. By 1875 he was the head draftsman for the firm.\nAs a later newspaper report put it, Latimer had been “thrust upward by his singular talent\nand drive.”\nLatimer’s drawing work brought him into contact with many inventors. The most\nfamous of these was Alexander Graham Bell, best known as the inventor of the telephone.\n*(25)* Latimer made several drawings which helped Bell claim the patents he sought. To draw\nthese designs as accurately as possible, it was necessary for Latimer to learn as much as he\ncould about Bell’s work. In the process Latimer became interested in the principles of\nelectricity, principles which underlay much of what Bell was doing. As Latimer read more\nand more about electric power, he became convinced that this form of energy could help\n*(30)* Americans in new and important ways.\n\nPatents\n\nIn the late 1870s Latimer began looking for a job that would allow him time to pursue\nhis new interests in technology. He was eventually offered a position at a company called\nthe United States Electric Lighting Corporation. The head of the company, Hiram Maxim,\n*(35)* was already well known among scientists for his work with electric power. Though\nThomas Edison had already patented the first truly effective electric light bulb, Maxim\nbelieved he could improve on Edison’s design. In particular, Maxim thought he could\nincrease the life span of the bulb. Toward that end, he hired the most intelligent and hard\nworking people he could find—including Latimer.\n*(40)* Latimer spent his first few months in Maxim’s employ trying to improve the bulb’s\nfilament—the wirelike assembly inside the bulb that gives off the actual light. In 1881, just\na year after joining Maxim’s firm, Latimer and a colleague patented a new and more\nefficient way of making filaments, using what their application called “a continuous strip\nof carbon secured to metallic wires.” The new procedure resulted in better, cheaper light\n*(45)* bulbs even than Edison had been able to produce. In the next months Latimer went on to\npatent several more inventions, each of which made light bulbs longer lasting and easier to\nmanufacture—and each of which brought more money to the corporation. Maxim’s\nconfidence in Latimer had paid off.\nLatimer did not spend all his time inventing. His work had made him an authority on\n*(50)* electric lighting, and Maxim consequently gave him more and more responsibility. Maxim\nsent him to Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to oversee factory operations. Later, Latimer\ntraveled to England to set up a new factory and to Montreal, Canada, to guide workers in\ninstalling electric lights in train stations. In Montreal he even learned some French to\ncommunicate with employees who spoke little or no English. “This was my mighty lesson,”\n*(55)* he wrote years later. “My day was spent climbing telegraph poles and locating arc lamps\non them with the assistance of my laborers who seemed much impressed with my effort to\nspeak their native language.”",
